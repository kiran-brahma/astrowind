For any Business owner or manager, it is important to ensure the safety and security of your premises. One of the most efficient ways to ensure security is the usage of CCTV cameras, which allow you to monitor and record video footage from your premises. Monitoring of CCTV feed is cumbersome and highly taxing, so utilising video analytics with human aid to make sense of the vast amount of data ensures a highly cost-effective security solution across your business

## **What is Video Analytics?**

In Video analytics, we apply machine learning algorithms to video data to extract useful information and insights. Video analytics helps in the identification of objects, people, faces, behaviours, events, and patterns in your CCTV footage. You can utilise Video analytics to alert you of any potential threats or anomalies in real-time, such as intruders, fire, smoke, vandalism, accidents, etc.

## **Local vs Cloud Processing**

There are two main methods of processing video data for analytics:

* Local: The video data is analyzed within the location premises with the aid of a local server and the device that captures it, such as the camera or a DVR.
    
* Cloud. In Cloud processing, the video data is uploaded to a remote server where it is analyzed by a cloud service provider.
    

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, performance, scalability, security, and privacy. However, we generally recommend utilisation of the cloud as it ensures optimum performance without any computing bottlenecks due to an increase in video feed.

## **What is Machine Learning**

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets of labelled video data to recognize patterns and features, relevant to video analytics. For example, a machine learning algorithm can learn to distinguish between humans and animals, cars and bikes, or between normal and abnormal behaviours.

However, machine learning is not perfect. Multiple mistakes are generated, learning to false positives. False positives are when the algorithm detects something that is not there or misinterprets something that is there. For example, a false positive can be when the algorithm thinks that a shadow is a person, that a balloon is a fire, or that a friendly visitor is an intruder. False positives can cause unnecessary alarms and waste your time and resources.

## **Why Human Intervention**

Human intervention is needed to verify and validate the results of video analytics. Human intervention means that you have a team of trained professionals who can review the video alerts generated by the algorithm, deciding its validity. They can further take further action based on the severity of the alter observed. Human intervention helps in fine-tuning the algorithm, improving its accuracy over time. In simple terms, Human intervention provides context and judgment that the algorithm lacks

## **Benefits of Video Analytics with Human Intervention**

Video analytics with human intervention is the right investment for your business to ensure the safety and security of your premises. Video analytics with human intervention helps in the reduction of false positives, improves efficiency, reduces physical security expenses, enhances customer experience, and complies with regulations. Video analytics with human intervention ensures your business premises are always under watchful eyes, providing you with a sense of security and peace of mind.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, CCTV cameras alone are never enough to ensure the safety and security of your business. You need to implement a video analytics solution with human supervision, ensuring that appropriate action is taken on a real-time basis based on the vast amount of data that CCTV generates. Video analytics with human intervention reduces false positives, improves efficiency, reduces physical security expenses, enhances customer experience, and complies with regulations. So, invest in video analytics with human intervention today and ensure the safety and security of your business.
