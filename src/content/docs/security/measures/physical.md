Physical security is an essential part of organisational safety regimen. It is a combination of physical and procedural measures designed to protect your personnel, information, and assets from threats. These measures should complement other security protocols already in place, such as those involving personnel, information handling,  and communications

## Benefits of Physical Security

Having strong physical security can help you:

- Keep your personnel, customers, and the public safe.
- Prevent unauthorized access to your premises, information, and assets.
- Maintain the confidence of those you serve or work with.
- Deliver services without disruption in the event of a heightened threat or disaster.

## Multi-Faceted Physical Security Threats

Threats to physical security can come from within or outside your organization. These could be visitors, contractors, the public, or external groups. Threats apply to personnel working in the office and away from it, particularly when they are working alone.

## Threats Examples

- Crime, including personal and property crime.
- Workplace violence, such as assaults, harassment, and revenge attacks.
- Civil disturbances, such as protests and riots.
- Natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and pandemics.
- Industrial disasters, such as explosions, building fires, and structural collapses.
- Terrorist acts, such as bombings, extortion, ‘white powder’ incidents, and kidnappings.
- Other risks, such as disturbed people and traffic accidents.

Internal physical security breaches can also be accidental. For example, if personnel are not aware of the risk of tailgating, they could allow unauthorized people entry into secure areas.
