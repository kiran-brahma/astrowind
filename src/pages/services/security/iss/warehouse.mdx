Theft of goods from warehouses is a crime that is often viewed as having a high potential for reward with little chance of being caught. However, this perception is flawed. In reality, cargo theft presents a significant danger to businesses, causing them to lose hundreds of thousands of rupees each year. Thieves typically target warehouses and storage facilities because of the high-value items that are often kept there, and many of these facilities are not equipped with adequate security measures to protect their inventory.

Surveillance of a warehouse is challenging due to its large area, multiple activities undertaken simultaneously, and multiple entry points.
