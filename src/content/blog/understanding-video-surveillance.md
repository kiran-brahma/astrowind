This blog explains the different types of remote video surveillance options available, including fully hosted systems, hybrid solutions, remote monitoring and mobile surveillance trailers.

## Choosing The Right System

Your business premises require a robust video surveillance system to protect valuable equipment, deter theft and vandalism, and monitor worker safety. With multiple options available, choosing the right system becomes a challenging task at hand

Here are the main types of video surveillance you should consider for your locations:

## Fully Hosted Video Surveillance

A fully hosted system means a third-party company is contracted to manage all aspects of your surveillance system. The vendor will be responsible for

* [Camera](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)
    
* [Analytics Software](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/video_analytics)
    
* Cloud Setup
    
* Operational Management of System for operations as per SLA
    
* [Remote Monitoring of Premises](https://blog.knighthood.co/whyremotemonitoring)
    

This option is also known as video surveillance as a service (VSaaS) or "cloud video surveillance."

Option for such a solution provides you with the following benefits:

* Simple setup and management. Limited technological know-how is required from your end. You explain your requirements and the vendor sets up everything for you
    
* No upfront hardware costs as everything is hosted on the cloud where you are charged monthly based on usage
    
* Scalable as your needs change. You can increase or decrease your cameras with ease
    
* Remote access to live and recorded footage on any device as the entire service is provided over the internet
    

However, you need to account for the fact that you have limited control over the entire hardware and need to account for monthly costs. You don't own any of the hardware and in case the contract ends, you lose access to all the infrastructure established by the vendor

## Hybrid Hosted Solutions

In a hybrid system, you invest in the cameras and recorders on-site. You connect your hardware to a cloud-hosted server where all the analytics and storage are undertaken. You can choose to remotely monitor the locations with your team or outsource to another agency within your premises

Opting for this solution allows you the following benefits:

* Lower monthly fees as some of the hardware is owned by you and you just pay for the cloud and remote monitoring solutions
    
* More control over hardware as you are paying for the same upfront and not forced to choose from a limited option set
    

However, you need to account for upfront costs for hardware. Secondly, the hardware requirement change as you add more CCTV within your premises. You will need to set up a team to ensure that all hardware is running as per requirements.

## Remote Monitored Surveillance

With [remote monitoring](https://blog.knighthood.co/whyremotemonitoring), trained security professionals watch your live footage from an off-site location. They monitor for suspicious activity, log daily events, and connect with local security personnel if needed.

Opting for this solution allows you the following benefits:

* You have access to 24/7 monitoring at a lower cost than on-site security in your locations. You can even choose to monitor only at specific locations and periods if you want to further optimize your expenses
    
* Personnel are trained to provide quick responses if any issues arise with the assistance of a local team
    
* You are provided access to advanced remote monitoring solutions using [AI](https://blog.knighthood.co/ai-remote) to provide you with advanced [analytics](https://blog.knighthood.co/human-supervision-analytics) for your business and security
    

However, you need to ensure that the location has a reliable internet connection for live video feeds, which is an issue in remote locations.

## Our Recommendation

We at Knighthood recommend a fully hosted video surveillance solution with remote monitoring for your organization based on the following factors:

### Reliability

Fully hosted systems place the responsibility of managing and maintaining the cameras on the provider. This greatly reduces downtime issues that plague on-premise solutions due to failed CCTV systems and lack of AMC. The provider ensures the cameras are always online and recording properly.

### 24X7 Monitoring

Having trained security personnel monitoring your security alerts with the assistance of Video analytics software around the clock is crucial to detect and responding to security threats promptly. In-house security staff are often overworked and miss minor but important alerts. Well-trained personnel can provide a higher level of vigilance.

### Flexibility

Fully hosted solutions scale easily as your needs change. You can add or remove cameras with ease, without the hassle of procuring and installing new hardware. Even though at the onset, it may make sense to purchase your server for the undertaking, we have observed that within short periods the servers are not able to handle the loads, leading to long delays in alerts.

### Incident Response

Professional monitoring teams have [standard operating procedures](/security/intro) for how to respond to different security incidents. They know when to alert you when to contact authorities and the appropriate next steps. This ensures a coordinated response that minimizes risks.

In summary, a fully hosted video surveillance solution with remote monitoring addresses the key issues most organizations have faced in the past related to CCTV reliability, incident response delays and lack of standard procedures. The benefits of scalability, ease of management and round-the-clock vigilance by security experts make it the ideal choice to secure your organization's properties and assets effectively.
