In India, one has to ensure that the company's payroll is compliant with the required laws and regulations.

Adhering to rules & regulations of the state in which the business is established is known as Statutory Compliance. These cover all the labor and taxation laws of the state. In India, your need to adhere to both national and state-level laws mandatorily. Thus, a company has to be well versed with all statutory labor regulations in India.

> *Last year (2020), the Indian Parliament combined 25 labour laws into three  codes, i.e., the Social Security Code, the Code on Industrial Relations  and the Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions.  The Code on Wages, enacted in 2019, also amalgamated four relevant labour laws. The Four new Labour Codes were supposed to be effective from 01 April 2021, however considering the rise in COVID cases and the potential impact of the new Codes on per employee costs for enterprises, the Government has delayed implementation of new Codes to a future date. The Central and State Governments have yet to notify the rules. The new legal provisions will be effective only, once notified.*
