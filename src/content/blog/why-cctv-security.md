Organizations are currently in flux as they transition to the post-pandemic world.

Recent research states that physical security and IT leaders feel more pressure than ever to maintain employee safety.

### Crime Prevention[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#crime-prevention)

Video surveillance systems can defend your organization against risks both inside and outside the office walls. Surveillance cameras with advanced analytics can track who is entering certain areas, whether they are following health and safety protocols, and whether occupancy of enclosed spaces remains within guidelines. By integrating your video system with your existing access control systems, you can help deter criminals and intruders, disrupting crime before it even starts and helping to protect precious inventory.

### Remote Monitoring[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#remote-monitoring)

Fewer in-office workers could give thieves and vandals more opportunities to commit crimes. Therefore, when looking at electronic surveillance systems, it is crucial to consider utilizing remote monitoring for those systems.

### Workflow Monitoring[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#workflow-monitoring)

Installing cameras throughout a facility doesn’t mean businesses are only recording theft. Cameras can be a highly beneficial asset in workflow monitoring. Video surveillance cameras can improve an organization’s workflow by identifying troublesome areas and helping to keep employees productive and engaged.

### Data Protection[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#data-protection)

In addition to protecting your people and facilities, organizations need to protect their proprietary data and critical infrastructure. Video surveillance technology can provide the same protection, including 24/7 monitoring, event triggers, and video verification, to ensure everyone who’s in your facility is supposed to be there.

### Business Continuity[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#business-continuity)

Security and IT leaders are also working to protect against significant impact on their businesses that is caused by disruption to their supply chain. For organizations that have a lot of inventory on-site, the sight of surveillance cameras can help deter criminals and intruders, disrupting crime before it even starts and helping to protect precious inventory.

### Cost Reduction[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#cost-reduction)

CCTV cameras can help you save money on security-related expenses, such as hiring security guards or installing alarms. CCTV cameras are relatively affordable and easy to maintain compared to other security systems. They can also lower your insurance premiums by demonstrating that you have taken measures to protect your business.

### Customer Satisfaction[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-cctv#customer-satisfaction)

CCTV cameras can help you enhance the quality of your products and services by ensuring that your standards are met and maintained. CCTV cameras can also help you attract more customers by showing that you care about their safety and satisfaction. Furthermore, CCTV cameras can help you collect valuable data about customer behaviour and preferences, which can help you improve your marketing strategies.

As you can see, CCTV surveillance is a smart investment for any business that wants to boost its security, profitability, and reputation. If you are interested in installing CCTV cameras at your business site, contact us today for a free consultation and quote.
