Warehouse security is crucial for almost every business nowadays, to prevent product loss due to theft or damage. In this blog post, we'll discuss eight types of warehouse security measures that can help create a high-security warehouse environment.

## Why Warehouse Security Matters[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#why-warehouse-security-matters)

Cargo or inventory still in the warehouse isn’t exempt from being stolen. India currently reports out of all the cargo thefts that occur, 64% occur within warehouses ([Ref](https://www.calipsa.io/blog/cargo-theft-warehouse-security-system)). A lack of warehouse security gives thieves an easy way to steal products and make a quick buck, and no business is immune to theft.

If you’re partnering with a third-party logistics (3PL) company, their [warehouse/distribution centre security](https://knighthood.co/security/supply_chain/risk) is still very much a concern since it affects your products.

## Protecting the Facility Inside and Out[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#protecting-the-facility-inside-and-out)

When it comes to warehouse security, it’s important to protect the facility both inside and out. External-facing warehouse security systems, called perimeter security, are used to defend entry points, parking lots, and the property line. These external security measures are useful for preventing theft by keeping thieves out of the warehouse or by intimidating casual thieves into thinking the theft attempt isn’t worth the effort and risk.

Internal warehouse security measures help to catch thieves who breach external warehouse security or employees who abuse their access to steal products from the warehouse. Instead of prevention and intimidation, [internal security measures](https://knighthood.co/security/measures/physical) often focus on limiting access or capturing evidence to help catch thieves after the fact.

It’s important to have layered security measures to protect the facility inside and out. In a warehouse, people are bringing things in and out regularly, and some of those people may not be your employees. There are probably multiple entrances and exits, and they might not all be manned 24/7. Because of how many entryways and exits there are in a warehouse, combined with the presence of non-warehouse personnel, it’s all too easy for a thief to infiltrate the warehouse and walk off with valuable goods amid the hustle and bustle. This is why both internal and external warehouse security solutions are necessary.

## Eight Types of Warehouse Security Measures[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#eight-types-of-warehouse-security-measures)

Here are eight types of warehouse security measures that can help create a high-security warehouse environment:

### [Warehouse Security Cameras](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)[​](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)

Security camera warehouse setups can be both a great deterrent to thieves and a simple way to gather strong evidence to pursue a case against them if they do steal something.

### Warehouse Lighting[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#warehouse-lighting)

Keeping warehouse facilities well-lit is a crucial safety measure for preventing theft and on-site accidents.

### [Alarm Systems](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)[​](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)

Alarm systems can deter theft attempts, minimize the number of goods stolen by thieves, and summon security or police in time to stop thieves from getting away.

### [Security Patrols](https://knighthood.co/services/Security/iss/patrol)[​](https://knighthood.co/services/Security/iss/patrol)

Manual security patrols can be a massive deterrent to casual thieves and trespassers that minimizes large-scale theft risks.

### [Access Control Systems and Security Cages](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)[​](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)

Security cages and access control systems create a high-security warehouse environment that minimizes theft risks.

### Inventory Tracking[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#inventory-tracking)

Inventory tracking solutions are vital for ensuring that inventory shrinkage can be identified quickly and that inventory availability reports in your e-commerce store are accurate.

### Entryway Security Doors[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#entryway-security-doors)

Robust doorways delay thieves, increasing the likelihood of them getting caught by police/security (and of them giving up before making entry).

### Window Security[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-types-warehouse#window-security)

Strong security means making windows as difficult to break into as possible, such as using reinforced glass, window locking mechanisms, or even steel bars/window covers to deter entry attempts.

While no security will ever be 100% proof against thieves, implementing these measures can help create a high-security warehouse that minimizes risks and better protects your products.
