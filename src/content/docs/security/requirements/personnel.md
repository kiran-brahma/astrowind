Ensure that all personnel of your organization (employees, contractors, and temporary staff) who have access to your company information and assets:

- Have had their identity verified
- Are legally allowed to work in the deployed location
- Are suitable to have access
- Agree to comply with government policies, standards, protocols, and requirements that protect people, information, and assets from harm.

## Ensure their ongoing suitability

Ensure your organization's ongoing suitability for all personnel. This responsibility entails addressing any issues that might impact their suitability to access government information and assets.

## Manage their departure

Manage people's departures to mitigate any risks to personnel, data and assets arising from their leaving your organization. This includes ensuring that all access rights, security passes and assets are returned and that employees understand their continuing obligations.

## Manage Security clearances

Ensure individuals have the corresponding level of security clearance before granting access to respective work locations within your premises. Monitor the ongoing suitability of all clearance holders and notify the relevant teams within your organization of any changes in their clearance.
