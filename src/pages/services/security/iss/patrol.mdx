Patrolling services are an important part of security for any premise. It involves a person or a group of people monitoring a property in order to protect it from any unauthorized activities or intruders. Knighthood has established a standard operating procedure (SOP) for such patrolling services and also makes use of video analytics to ensure that the process of patrolling is carried out effectively.

## What is Patrolling?

Patrolling involves keeping a watchful eye on a premise by regularly moving around the area. This ensures that any suspicious activity is quickly identified and addressed. Patrolling can be done manually or with the help of technology such as CCTV cameras.

## Knighthood's Patrolling SOP

Knighthood's SOP for patrolling services is designed to ensure maximum security. The SOP includes details such as the frequency of patrolling, the patrol routes, and the type of equipment that should be used. Additionally, the patrolling team is also provided with specific instructions to ensure that all areas of the premise are monitored and that any suspicious activities are reported to the relevant authorities.

## Video Analytics for Patrolling Services

In addition to manual patrolling, Knighthood also uses video analytics to monitor premises. Video analytics involves the use of algorithms to analyze video footage from CCTV cameras. This allows for quicker identification of any suspicious activity and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the premise.



At Knighthood, we are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality security services. We collaborate with them to create a combination of static guarding, patrolling guards, and remote monitoring to ensure 24/7 protection at the most economical price without sacrificing quality.
