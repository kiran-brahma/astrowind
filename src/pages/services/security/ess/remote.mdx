Monitoring of CCTV video systems is becoming increasingly common, especially in areas where police departments require verification before dispatching an alarm call from a commercial intrusion alarm system. Used in conjunction with an intrusion alarm system, video monitoring can be a powerful tool to bolster security and protect employees.

Not many people are aware of how video monitoring works and how a monitoring station uses these systems. We partner with Staqu Technologies and their Jarvis platform to provide the backbone of our remote monitoring system. Your existing CCTV system can be integrated with this software, and no additional expenses (other than the monthly monitoring fees) are necessary.

We offer three types of remote monitoring services to our customers.

## Live Video Monitoring

Remote agents monitor your cameras on a full-time basis. An operator may not view all cameras at once, but they typically monitor 4-5 at a time. This is an intensive process, so we charge accordingly. It's not the most cost-effective option, but some locations may require it. Additionally, customers can request that video streams be sent to our remote monitoring center, making it data-intensive.

## Scheduled Video Monitoring

This type of video monitoring involves checking in on cameras at predetermined times for a client, usually to verify that certain events are taking place or that specific protocols are being followed. Examples include deliveries, guard tours, arrivals, or any other event the client needs monitored. This type of video monitoring is not as intensive as live video monitoring, and it uses less data since the scheduled video check-ins are shorter.

## Triggered Video Monitoring or Event-Driven Video Monitoring

Video monitoring involves viewing CCTV cameras in response to a specific event at a client's location. This could be an alarm from an intrusion system, a video analytics platform, a building's supervisory system, or any other event that requires a video check-in. This type of monitoring is also known as "video verification" and is the most effective way to monitor video.

When an alarm is received from a specific zone, a pre-determined camera in that area can be selected for viewing. An operator can view a live shot of the alarm and a recorded section of the alarm to determine the cause. This helps to validate the alarm and reduce false dispatches of police.

Once viewed, established protocols are followed, and all steps taken during the process are recorded in the our automation software. This procedure can be repeated for any event that requires an operator to view the cameras.

There are three types of video monitoring solutions available to enhance the safety and security of your business. Knowing how each works can help you decide which one is best for you. Knighthood offers these solutions to our clients.
