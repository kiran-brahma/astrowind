# Securely Digitizing your Records

Conventional wisdom used to say that the only safe way to store sensitive information was with physical documents that were securely locked away. However, as digital security technology has become more reliable and user-friendly, more and more people have opted to store data digitally. Digital files can be backed up in multiple locations, are not as vulnerable to fires or disasters, and can't be physically stolen.

## Why Digitize your Records

Physical storage isn't as secure as people assume. Multiple business have observed an alarmingly high number of paper data breaches. Digitization helps in long-term storage and quick-access of relevant documents. Cloud-based digital storage allows for large databases to be stored for long periods of time without taking up office space.

## Safely Digitizing your documents

We begin digitizing your existing documents using the following process:

- We install a secure room in your premises or send all relevant documents to our premises via secure courier services.
- We disconnect the digitization hardware from the internet.
- We scan documents and save the initial image files.
- After all documents have been digitized, we back them up on a secure cloud.
- You decide what to do with the physical records. If they are not needed, we verify that all documents are available in the cloud and then destroy them.

- Read access
- Edit access.

We also collaborate with our customers to determine how the data will be accessedâ€”whether via mobile, web, or limited to a specific IP within their premises.
