Knighthood focuses on helping our customers create a security culture where everyone in the organization contributes. No amount of investment in physical security can be truly effective without a strong security culture. Even one person being let into the premises without permission or an unsecured reception area can put the entire organization at risk.

## Training

We make sure that people and partners understand the security risks, physical security policies, and the right security behaviors. We provide security awareness communications, training, and support to establish a robust security culture. We ensure that everyone is aware of the physical security policies.

We encourage people to report potential issues or near misses. We want them to know that they will be seen as helpful and not as troublemakers.

## Emergency Security Procedures

Knighthood makes sure that physical security procedures complement the organization's emergency procedures. We provide everyone with a summary of the emergency and security procedures designed for their safety. This includes contact details for security and emergency response personnel, as well as emergency responders such as the police (dial 100).

We publicize the evacuation procedures in case of an earthquake, fire, bombing, or incident involving a chemical or biological hazard. We make sure everyone knows about any specific security procedures, such as how to report a bomb threat or suspicious mail, handle aggressive people, conduct interviews, and keep vehicles safe. We also ensure that everyone is aware of any lock-down procedures implemented to secure information and physical assets.
