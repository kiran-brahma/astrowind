Security services have undergone rapid changes in the past few decades. Technological strides have made threats more complex, but they have also given us the means to tackle them.

At Knighthood, we call our security services ‘integrated security’. This means combining traditional security techniques with modern technology. It also means taking a wide view of security, including physical security (like guards and CCTV), cyber security, health and safety, and business continuity.

Our ‘Integrated Security Solution Model’ helps us partner with clients to identify their risks, needs and challenges. We then create a custom security plan for them. This model helps us manage all of our client’s security risks.

Using this model, we work with our clients to assess and put in place the necessary measures to create a safe environment. We do this by looking at three main areas: risk management, personnel, and technology.

## Risk Management​
Our role is to protect people, assets and reputations from potential harm caused by security breaches. To do this, we need to understand our client’s organisation, its operations, strategic objectives, and what needs to be protected. This is referred to as “establishing the context”.

We then identify and assess threats, vulnerabilities, and the resulting levels of risk. We recommend security controls designed to address and mitigate these. Our risk management approach ensures that security controls are aligned with the organisation’s overall strategy and that security plays its role as a ‘strategic enabler’.

## Personnel​
Knighthood has around 10,000+ staff across the country. Our security officers perform a range of roles, including guarding and patrolling, event security, retail loss prevention, incident management and response.

Our people are professional, well-trained, and trusted to deliver security outcomes. As part of an integrated security solution, security personnel are an important security measure and can play a key role in ensuring all aspects of the solution work together.

## Technology​
Knighthood has always adopted the latest technology for our security services to customers. We work with our customers to develop Security solutions using the latest technological solutions, resulting in cost savings and better efficiency of our security services.

Knighthood provides an integrated security solution model to its clients that assesses and delivers necessary measures to create a safe and secure environment. This model incorporates risk management, personnel, and technology, including traditional security practices and technologically enabled measures, as well as physical security measures, cyber security, health and safety, and business continuity. Knighthood's 10,000+ staff are well-trained and trusted to deliver security outcomes, and the company is a leader in the application of technology to the provision of physical security services.

We at Knighthood have been working with over 200+ organisations for over 5 years. We focus on ensuring high service levels at affordable prices. You can read more about why our customers choose to [work with us](/whyus).
