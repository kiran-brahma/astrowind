As a warehouse manager, safety and security should be at the top of your list of priorities. In this article, we'll share some of the most important safety and security measures you should implement to maintain safe and secure operations in your facility.

## Safety Measures[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#safety-measures)

### Forklifts[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#forklifts)

Forklifts are one of the most common hazards in a warehouse. Operators must be appropriately trained and certified to use them, and periodic evaluations should be conducted. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), forklift accidents account for 95,000 injuries across all industries each year. To prevent accidents in your warehouse, it’s recommended that forklift operators are properly trained, examine the area before driving a forklift, never exceed 5 mph, and maintain proper haulage equipment.

### Docks[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#docks)

Forklift safety guidelines should be followed at all times, especially when one is being operated on a dock. Along with items falling from docks and striking workers, another common problem are forklifts that run off the dock, injuring the driver and possibly anyone else in the area. Employees should drive slowly and never go in reverse. Ladders and stairs should meet OSHA’s guidelines.

### Materials Storage[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#materials-storage)

Items that are stored incorrectly could fall and injure anyone inside a warehouse. Positioning items evenly and placing heavier loads at lower distances can prevent falls from occurring.

### Manual Lifting/Handling[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#manual-liftinghandling)

Using proper lifting techniques will reduce the chances of debilitating back injuries from occurring.

### Charging Stations[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#charging-stations)

To prevent fires, explosions and related injuries, we recommend banning smoking and open flames, keeping an adequate inventory of fire extinguishers, and properly positioning forklifts before charging.

### Chemicals[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#chemicals)

Warehouse operators should ensure they comply with local, state, and federal regulators at all times, especially for warehouses that store hazardous chemicals. Warehouses should be equipped with Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), which contain all the relevant information about the chemical, including possible hazards, proper storage and handling, first-aid and firefighting measures, toxicological information, exposure controls, and more. Providing employees access to SDSs is necessary for chemical warehouses.

## Security Measures[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#security-measures)

### [Security System](https://knighthood.co/security/planning/strategy)[​](https://knighthood.co/security/planning/strategy)

A state-of-the-art security system that includes alarms and surveillance cameras near all access points is essential for the safety and security of a warehouse. Videos can typically be viewed in real-time or days later and would likely require cloud storage.

### Fencing[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#fencing)

Fencing provides an extra layer of security and makes it exceedingly difficult for anyone with bad intentions from accessing the facility.

### Employees[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-safety#employees)

Employees that are aware of their surroundings and can identify when something doesn’t seem right can be your best protection against potential security breakdowns. Conduct background checks on new employees, as is customary in most industries.

Remember, operating an efficient warehouse requires a multi-pronged strategy, including complete dedication to safety and security. Implement these measures immediately to ensure your warehouse remains running like a well-oiled machine.
