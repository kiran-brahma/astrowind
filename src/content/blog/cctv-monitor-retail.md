Understanding the psychology of perpetrators is key to selecting the most effective retail store security measures. In multiple studies undertaken by us with our customers over the past 5 years, 67% of our customers stated clearly that security guards were the most effective deterrent, followed by overlooked premises (52%), CCTV (41%), passive infrared sensors (37%), alarmed windows (19%), alarmed doors (15%), and bolted doors (4%).

## Studies[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/cctv-monitor#studies)

A [2019 meta-analysis](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1275&context=jj_pubs) published in the journal *Criminology & Public Policy*, involving 76 studies, found that CCTV schemes with active monitoring generated larger effect sizes (i.e. more significant reductions in crime) than those with passive systems. Additionally, those schemes that deployed multiple interventions alongside CCTV generated larger effect sizes than those with single or no other interventions.

When surveying a property or public space with CCTV, the presence of security officers in a control room, a monitoring centre, police, or security guards/patrols providing additional ‘eyes on the ground’ is more likely to reduce crime than non-monitored CCTV or CCTV operating without other security controls.

When it comes to security measures, they are least effective when used as ‘point solutions’, and are most effective when deployed as part of a range of measures. Knighthood provides security guarding and patrol services for a diverse range of retailers across India. Our officers are trained in customer service, detecting risks and threats, responding to incidents, de-escalating potential conflict situations, and supporting clients’ facilities management requirements.
