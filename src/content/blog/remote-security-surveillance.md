Lately, the trend to engage the services of remote security surveillance is on the rise due to their cost-effectiveness and efficiency in safeguarding businesses and properties. These digital guardians employ a blend of CCTV cameras, video analytics, alarms, and monitoring centres to ensure continuous surveillance and swift responses.


## The Emergence of Remote Security Guards

In today's world, with the increase in crime and security issues, the need for 24/7 remote security monitoring for properties has never been more apparent. It is no longer possible to just rely on the physical presence of traditional security guards. The rise in electronic surveillance systems along with AI is ushering in the era of remote security guards. These high-tech systems are revolutionising security by combining cutting-edge technology and physical security guards to provide round-the-clock property monitoring.

The reasons behind the growing popularity of remote security surveillance are manifold. Implementation of such solutions brings substantial cost savings. Scaling traditional security personnel can be costly when you consider manpower expenses. In contrast, deploying remote surveillance to scale security systems is much more economical

Remote surveillance services are highly efficient. You can monitor multiple locations simultaneously, allowing for the limited on-site security staff to focus on essential tasks.

## Remote Surveillance vs. Traditional Security

Today, a new contender has emerged in the security arena: remote video surveillance, empowered by AI. The demand for security services is on the rise, requiring security providers to shift toward remote security solutions. The primary focus is to ensure complete security needs without an increase in costs.

Choosing between remote surveillance and traditional security requires one to understand each option's own set of strengths and weaknesses. Traditional security services offer a personal touch but come with higher costs, limited availability, and potential delays in response times. On the flip side, remote surveillance, with its reliance on technology and 24/7 remote security monitoring for properties, offers cost efficiency, constant vigilance, rapid response times, and scalability.

## **Advantages of Remote Security Guard Services**

Now, let's delve into why businesses and property owners are increasingly embracing remote security guards:

### **Cost-Effective Solutions:** 
Remote security services are often more budget-friendly than [hiring and maintaining on-site security personnel](https://knighthood.co/blog/security-guard-cost). They translate to savings on manpower and administrative expenses for your organisation

### **24/7 Monitoring:** 
Unlike human security guards who can't be present at all locations and require breaks, remote security operates 24X7. This ensures your property is under constant watch, day and night, reducing the risk of security lapses.

### **AI's Superhuman Capabilities:** 
AI remains alert around the clock without fatigue or distractions. With the aid of AI, you can analyse multiple feeds simultaneously, detecting anomalies and potential threats that might escape human surveillance.

### **Reduced False Alarms:** 
The adoption of AI in your remote monitoring enhances accuracy in identifying security threats, and reduces false alarms that occur with traditional security systems. However, do keep in mind that even adoption of AI, remote surveillance services remain susceptible to errors but at a much lower occurrence than before

### **Scalability:** 
Whether you possess a small storefront or a vast industrial complex, remote security solutions can be tailored to meet your needs. This flexibility allows businesses to scale up or down as per business requirements. With remote surveillance solutions, it's easier to adapt and allocate resources as required.

## The Future of Remote Surveillance

The future of remote surveillance services holds vast potential for growth. As AI technology system evolves, remote security surveillance services will become even more advanced and efficient.

### **Enhanced AI and Machine Learning:**
The cornerstone of remote security solutions is [artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.](https://knighthood.co/blog/ai-remote-monitoring) These technologies are advancing rapidly, with AI algorithms becoming increasingly adept at recognising patterns and anomalies, thereby improving threat detection.
### **Integration with IoT (Internet of Things):** 
IoT provides instant connectivity to our physical world, including security systems. You can easily integrate with IoT devices such as smart cameras, sensors, and access control systems. This integration will provide real-time data and insights, enhancing proactive and efficient security monitoring.

### **Predictive Analytics:** 
The future of remote surveillance services will be predictive. Advanced analytics will empower security systems to predict potential threats based on historical data and current trends, preventing security breaches before they occur, and enhancing overall safety.

### **Mobile and Cloud Accessibility:** 
Accessibility will play a crucial role in the future of remote guarding. Security personnel will have real-time access to data and video feeds on their mobile devices, enabling quick responses from anywhere. Cloud-based solutions will simplify data management and analysis, facilitating efficient security operations.

## Best Practices for Remote Surveillance

If you're considering implementing remote surveillance solutions in your business, thorough research is paramount. Understand the type of property or business you intend to secure and choose the most suitable security solutions for your needs. Choosing between remote surveillance and traditional security requires a clear understanding of your business needs.

### Cost[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#remote-security-monitoring-cost)

You need to account for the following expenses:

- **One Time Expenses**
    
    - IP-Enabled CCTV Camera
- **Monthly Recurring Expenses**
    
    - Dedicated Internet: 1 MBPS required per camera
        
    - Cloud Hosting and Operations Expenses
        
    - Cloud Storage Cost
        
    - Analytics Software Subscription Charges
        
    - Remote Monitoring Subscription
        

You can expect to spend around **₹ 9000- 12,500** for an IP-based camera. Monthly expenses will be around **₹2,000 to ₹4,000** per camera, depending on the features chosen and other service needs of your company. You will also need to account for Internet expenses, which should cost around ₹300 per camera.

Assuming a 3-year life for the CCTV, you will need to budget between **₹2,700 to ₹5,000** for enabling remote monitoring on your premises.

If you are concerned about privacy, you can choose to host the monitoring software and monitoring team on your premises. However, this option costs more than shared resources, which are based on a monthly subscription charge.

Keep in mind that the unit costs tend to fall as the number of cameras increases, so it makes sense to negotiate with a single vendor for all locations to optimise costs.
