## What is a Security Breach?

A security breach is an accidental or unintentional action that leads or could lead to the compromise of safety for your people, or the loss or damage of official information or resources.

### Examples

- Losing or leaving access passes or identification documents insecure
- Leaving protectively marked material in UNCLASSIFIED waste bins
- Not properly securing or storing protectively marked material

### Informing your Chief Security Officer (CSO)

- You must report all security breaches to your CSO.
- The CSO will assess the situation and determine the appropriate response.

For further information on the process following a security breach, please refer to our [Reporting incidents and conducting security investigations](/security/governance/incident) page.

You can learn more about this topic by reviewing our [Protective security roles and responsibilities](/security/governance/security) page.

## How is workplace security determined?

Knighthood recommends that organizations take a risk-based approach to determining the security measures needed to keep their customers, people, information, and assets safe.

### Key considerations

- Each organization should assess threats and risks to determine their own security needs.

- The level and degree of security measures required depend on the size of the premises, the work conducted on the premises (such as whether the premises requires protectively marked material), and the risks they face.

Knighthood can provide additional advice if needed. For more information, visit the following pages:
