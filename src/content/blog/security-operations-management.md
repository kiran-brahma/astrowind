## Introduction

You currently oversee the security and vigilance for a large warehouse complex  Your job? -
- Protect the Inventory within the warehouse 
- Defend against Thieves
- Ensure the safety of everyone inside. 

A comprehensive Security Operations Management System (SOMS) ensures that you don't fail in your job. You can consider it as a strategic command centre, and blueprint, ensuring the safety of your warehouse 24X7

This blog post from Knighthood provides a brief on developing a robust SOMS for your organisation.

## What's in a SOMS?

In Simple words, SOMS is the central nervous system for your organisation's security efforts.  It's a structured approach to [managing security operations](/security/requirements/governance), ensuring that every aspect of your security works every time.

A well-designed SOMS is like a conductor leading an orchestra. An orchestra achieves a symphony by bringing together every instrument, allowing each instrument to play its part. Effective SOMS ensures the same, allowing each security measure to play an effective role in your organisation's safety

## Understand Your Organisation

To establish an effective SOMS, you need to have a clear and deep understanding of your organisation. Key factors that you need to consider are as explained below

### Objectives, Strategies, and Business Mission

Your SOMS should be a reflection of your organisation's goals and aspirations. 
   Ask yourself the following questions:
   - What are we trying to achieve as a company?
   - How do our security measures support our business strategies?
   - What risks are we willing to take to achieve our mission?

   For instance, for a company that pushes for rapid innovation, its SOMS will need to balance robust security with flexibility to support quick development cycles.

### Values, Ethos, and Culture

   Security isn't just about technology or processes; it needs to focus on your employees and other vendors involved in your operations daily. 
   
   The SOMS has to align with and reinforce your company's values. Consider the following:
   - How do people within our organisation view security?
   - Are our employees security-conscious, or require training to develop the mindset?
   - How can we make security a part of our company's DNA?
If SOMS is not built on the foundation of robust security awareness and buy-in from everyone, it is bound to fail despite the deployment of the latest technology for our security

### Capabilities, Resources, and Assets

   To develop an effective SOMS, you need to understand:
   - What resources do we have at our disposal?
   - What are our most critical assets that need protection?
   - Where are our security strengths and weaknesses?
   
   A thorough investigation of your current physical assets, digital assets and human capabilities needs to be undertaken to answer the above questions. Always bear in mind that while your employees are your most valuable assets, they are also potentially your biggest security vulnerability


## Key Components of Your SOMS

Once you have developed a clear understanding of various aspects of your Organisation, you need to commence with the development of the key components of your SOMS

### Risk Assessment and Management

Your SOMS needs to be built on a comprehensive understanding of every risk your organisation faces and might face in the future. You need to take into account the following:

   - Identifying potential [threats](/security/measures/management#know-the-threats-and-risks-you-need-to-manage)
   - Assessing the likelihood and potential impact of these threats
   - Developing strategies to [mitigate or manage these risks](/security/planning/risk)

### Security Policies and Procedures

A robust security policy and procedure details rules to be followed by everyone for your security efforts. They need to be clear, comprehensive and communicated effectively to all everyone within your organisation

In most organisations, security policies gather dust in a drawer that is rarely referred to in cases of emergencies. It is important to ensure that these documents guide daily operations and decision-making within your organisation

### [Incident Response Plan](/security/governance/incident)

Despite our best efforts, no fortress is impenetrable. Hence your SOM should state how to respond when faced with a security incident. The incident response plan should detail the following:
   - Incident detection and classification
   - Containment strategies
   - Recovery procedures
   - Post-incident analysis and learning

### Training and Awareness Programs

Always bear in mind that your employees are your first line of defence. Ensure that regular [training and awareness programs](/security/governance/awareness) are undertaken. The training schedule needs to be a part of your SOMS. 

These programs should:
   - Educate employees about potential security risks
   - Teach best practices for maintaining security
   - Foster a [security culture](/security/measures/management#a-security-culture) within the organisation

### Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

A SOMS can't be treated as a one-time exercise and needs to be updated continuously reflecting changing priorities for your organisation's goal while tackling implementation challenges for operations.

It should include mechanisms for:
   - Continuously monitoring security performance
   - Regularly assessing the effectiveness of security measures
   - Adapting to new threats and changing business needs

## Implementing Your SOMS

Once you have a clear blueprint for your SOMS, you need to shift focus on how to implement it effectively. Key steps that you need to account for are briefed in the below sections.

### Get Buy-In from Top Management

   Your SOMS needs support from the top management of your organisation. Make sure that your company's leadership understands SOMS importance and they are committed to its success.

### Start Small, Think Big

Most implementations fail due to the enforcement of SOMS on an immediate basis. We recommend that you commence with critical areas, gradually expanding its scope till all aspects are covered. You need to let it grow and evolve with your organisational needs
### Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

Undertake training and awareness programs that ensure that every person is aware of his/her role within the SOMS. To ensure successful adoption, you need to provide regular updates, explain rules and have an open mind for employee feedback on changes or challenges in adoption. 

### Leverage Technology

Evaluate tools that allow for the automation of routine security activities, while providing you with [real-time monitoring](/services/security/ess/remote) of any security incidents within your premises

### Be Flexible
Your organisation's goals and business needs are always evolving, hence SOMS should be flexible enough to adapt to any changes or threats or technological or business needs


## Conclusion

Successful development and implementation of a Security Operations Management System is no small task. It requires careful planning, commitment, and requiring continuous effort. 

A well-designed SOMS not only protects your organisation from threats, it empowers your employees to proceed ahead with confidence.
