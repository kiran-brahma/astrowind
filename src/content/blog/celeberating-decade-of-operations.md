# Celebrating a Decade of Excellence: Knighthood's Journey of Reliability, Innovation, and Success

10 years back, we at Knighthood started our services with a simple goal to provide alternatives to Organisations seeking security services without any hassles while avoiding the cost of premium service providers. We aimed to bridge the gap between premium service providers and low-cost players that often compromise on compliance and quality. 

Today as we celebrate our 10th anniversary, it's a moment of reflection and gratitude for the incredible journey that brought us here.


## Inception: Bridging the Service Gap

Ten years ago, Knighthood was started with a simple goal to provide reliable services to customers. We understood the need for a reliable security service provider that not only adhered to government regulations but also offered cost-effective solutions unlike the options available in the market.  The market was dominated by large players charging a premium and budget providers compromising on compliance. This left a void for organisations seeking compliant and reliable contract workforce solutions.

Surprisingly, even today today very few service providers have focussed on ensuring labour compliance without charging a high premium.

## Early Struggles and Triumphs

In our first year of operations, it was a hassle to convince customers despite a stellar team with decades of experience in this domain. We faced numerous challenges in securing contracts. However, our commitment to reliability and unwavering focus on delivering top-notch services gradually won the trust of our clients. 

Today, we proudly serve over 140+ corporates, with an impressive 60% of our current customers date have using our services for 5+ years. Our first 10 customers who trusted us continue to rely on us even today, indicating our commitment to reliability and service level

From a humble team of 15 at the end of our first year, we currently manage a workforce of over 15,000 personnel across India.

## Key Success Factors: Reliability and Quality

Our success undoubtedly is due to our unwavering commitment to reliability while ensuring we are cost-competitive. Since the first month of our operations, we have ensured timely payment to employees and 100% adherence to all government regulations to every associate who has worked or is working with us even today

Our relentless pursuit of service excellence has contributed to high customer retention and a solid reputation in the industry. The following numbers speak for themselves regarding our focus on service and customer satisfaction
* 90% of Customers renew their yearly service agreement with us 
* 99.3% SLA across all services provided by us
* 0.8% Absenteeism across all manpower deployed in 2023

## Technological Evolution

We at Knighthood embraced technology early on. While many competitors even today still rely on cash transactions, we transitioned to 100% digital payroll within the first year of operations. Over the past decade, we have strived hard to digitise every aspect of our business operations, ensuring transparency to all our customers. This commitment has laid the foundation for our future endeavours in adopting cutting-edge technology to enhance service quality.

## Future Initiatives: Embracing Change
Looking forward, we aim to develop newer business and service models, ensuring the needs of our customers are met more economically. In the coming year, we plan to introduce a Gig Workers model, providing companies with the flexibility to engage short-term manpower without extensive liabilities and costs. 

Simultaneously, we will undertake a comprehensive revamp of our operational processes, digitising every aspect and introducing automation for streamlined efficiency. A revamped customer portal will offer real-time access to operational and financial metrics, aligning with contemporary business needs.

## Gratitude and Cheers to the Future

As we celebrate this milestone, Knighthood extends heartfelt gratitude to our valued customers and dedicated employees who have been an integral part of our journey. Your trust and support have been the driving force behind our success over the past decade. Here's to the next 10 years of growth, innovation, and continued excellence! Cheers to the future!
