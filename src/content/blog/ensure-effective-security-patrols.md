Security Issues can easily be avoided if you have developed a [robust mobile patrol system](https://blog.knighthood.co/benefits-of-mobile-security-patrols-and-remote-monitoring) with well-trained guards.

Several proactive steps can be taken to ensure effective security patrols:

1. Establish regular checkpoints along patrol routes.
    
2. Closely monitor guard compliance.
    
3. Install efficient guard tracking systems. Technologies such as RFID tags, GPS devices, and mobile apps can provide real-time location data for guards.
    
4. Adopt a [Video Analytics system](https://blog.knighthood.co/whyremotemonitoring) to track guard movements
    

## Efficient Guard Tracking System

Implementing an efficient guard tracking system is highly beneficial for businesses in several ways. You can adopt any of the below processes

* QR code scanning and GPS tracking allow managers to objectively verify that patrols are being conducted properly and thoroughly
    

* The digital audit trail created by technologies like QR codes, NFC tags and GPS data helps ensure accountability and compliance. Guards know their patrols are being monitored, which discourages cutting corners.
    

* Remote monitoring enables supervisors and remote teams an oversight of patrols in progress, allowing them to intervene quickly if issues arise or deviations from routes occur. This reduces response times to potential security threats.
    
* Collecting and analyzing guard tracking data over time can reveal patterns of issues, inefficiencies or problem areas that need to be addressed. The data can then be used to optimize patrol routes, procedures and resource allocation.

## Methods To Ensure Effective Security Patrols

Implementing thorough and effective security patrols requires a systematic and multilayered approach. Several key factors need to be considered to minimize the chances of missed areas and deviations from procedures.

### Establish Clear Patrol Protocols

Establishing clear and detailed [security procedures](/security/planning/procedure) is paramount. The procedures should specify the designated patrol routes, checkpoints to be covered and the exact responsibilities of security personnel during each shift.

Providing security staff with straightforward guidelines and expectations helps minimize the possibility of omitting areas unintentionally.

### Efficient Scheduling and Management

Adopt a robust and reliable scheduling system to assign patrol shifts efficiently and ensure all areas have adequate coverage. You can adopt technology-driven tools that streamline scheduling processes, allocate resources optimally and avoid potential conflicts or gaps in coverage.

A well-managed scheduling system is integral to achieving efficient security patrols for your premises

### **Training and Skill Development**

Ensure that every staff in the security team is provided with [comprehensive training](/security/measures/culture) to security personnel on relevant topics such as

* Patrol procedures
    
* [Emergency response protocols](https://knighthood.co/security/measures/culture#emergency-security-procedures)
    

Adoption of appropriate technology tools that assist security personnel in their patrols. Continuous skill and knowledge development helps security staff carry out patrols more effectively and reduces the likelihood of missing critical areas due to a lack of understanding.

### **Tracking Systems**

You can leverage real-time location tracking systems with GPS or RFID technology to monitor the progress of patrols. These systems allow supervisors to track the locations of security personnel, verify that checkpoints are being visited as scheduled, and receive alerts if any checkpoints are missed or delayed.

You can also choose to utilise [remote monitoring](https://blog.knighthood.co/whyremotemonitoring) to track the movement of Security personnel in their patrol. When any deviation in the patrol process is observed, alerts are raised and remote teams can connect with local teams to intimate the alert

Such technology solutions provide valuable oversight to ensure patrol thoroughness.

### **Supervision and Communication**

Maintaining clear and open communication with security personnel is imperative for thorough patrols. Staff must always understand their exact responsibilities and any changes to schedules or procedures.

Supervisors play a key role by:

* Regularly communicating updates to patrol routes, checklists and expectations
    
* Periodically monitoring patrols in person to observe compliance firsthand
    
* Promptly addressing issues or gaps found during monitoring
    
* Providing guidance, feedback and support to reinforce best practices
    

Direct supervisor involvement through in-person monitoring and communication reinforces the importance of comprehensive patrols. It allows issues to be identified and resolved quickly before becoming recurring problems. Timely guidance and feedback help staff understand what is expected of them and how to improve. Overall, regular communication and monitoring from supervisors provide the structure and support needed to optimize patrol activities.

### **Performance Evaluation and Accountability**

Implement a robust performance evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of security personnel in carrying out patrols as per documented procedures. Clear metrics for evaluation may include

* Adherence to patrol routes
    
* Verification of checkpoint visits,
    
* Response times to incidents.
    

Regular performance reviews promote accountability and provide opportunities for improvement.

### Reporting and Documentation

The Security procedure developed needs to encourage prompt incident reporting and thorough documentation of any incidents or observations during patrols. You need to collect the following data\\

* Incident Details
    
* TimeStamps
    
* Supporting Evidence
    
* Incident Impact
    
* Response
    

Adopting robust incident management and reporting system facilitates subsequent incident analysis, pattern identification and optimization of patrol strategies.

### Security Audits

Regular audits and quality checks of patrols are critical. They verify that security staff are following the documented procedures. Any deviations, gaps or issues found present opportunities for improvement. Addressing these promptly enhances future patrols.

Conducting audits periodically:

* Confirms checkpoints are visited as scheduled
    
* Ensures patrol routes and responsibilities are followed
    
* Identifies areas where procedures are unclear or inadequate
    
* Reveals potential training needs for staff
    

By addressing issues found during audits, patrols become more thorough and complete. Making corrections and adjustments based on audit results enhances future patrol effectiveness and reduces the chances of checkpoints being missed.

### Analysis

Regular analysis of patrol data is essential for continuous improvement. Key data points include duration, frequency and checkpoint visit rates.

Analyzing this data for individual security staff and teams reveals performance trends over time. It highlights where improvements are needed through targeted actions like:

* Additional training to address knowledge gaps
    
* Corrective measures to address specific issues
    
* Adjustments to patrol procedures to enhance effectiveness
    

Such analysis is most valuable when done periodically. It provides important insights into adherence levels, consistency across shifts, and other trends.

The insights from data-driven evaluation enable tailored improvements that make patrols more thorough and reduce the likelihood of missed checks.

## Conclusion

A multi-pronged strategy is vital for thorough security patrols. This involves establishing clear and defined procedures that outline patrol routes and checkpoints. Technology solutions such as GPS tracking systems, and remote monitoring enable real-time monitoring and alerts regarding deviations.

Supervisors conducting periodic audits and providing guidance ensure procedures are followed properly. Implementing performance metrics and an incident reporting system promotes accountability and compliance. Data from tracking systems enable evaluation of individual performance and patrol effectiveness.

Together, these elements create a comprehensive patrol program with redundancies to minimize the possibility of areas being missed. Regular adjustments based on audit findings and performance reviews further refine and optimize the patrol program over time, continuing to reduce the likelihood of missed patrols.
