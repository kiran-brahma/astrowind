People can plot stealing or other bad activity when they can foresee how security personnel would react and behave.

## Plainclothes Security Guards[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-guards#plainclothes-security-guards)

There are two important justifications for hiring a plainclothes security guard.

* The first is if there is a circumstance in which uniformed police would upset or frighten individuals. A guard in a uniform walking around would likely look out of place, but you might see this during a wedding or special event where security is required.
    
* The guards in plain clothes make people feel more at ease, but they also offer critical security in some circumstances. When there are valuables to protect and owners of businesses or homes don't want passersby to know they are being watched, you might notice a plainclothes guard People are bound to behave more naturally when they aren't seeing someone in a uniform.
    

They are more prone to steal or take from a business when they behave more naturally. Of course, this isn't the same as creeping up on someone; rather, it just lets people act as they normally would while still effectively protecting their possessions and other people. High-end stores that don't want to project the image of an officer in uniform are also suitable candidates for plainclothes security personnel. The presence of security guards might occasionally detract from the atmosphere of the store and give customers anxiety.

## Armed Security Guards[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-guards#armed-security-guards)

One who carries a weapon around is referred to as an armed guard. A security guard or officer may require a firearm to complete their duty effectively depending on the circumstances surrounding their employment. The armed guards are extremely skilled security officers.

These guards get far more training since whenever there are weapons present, there will be situations and scenarios where life or death is at stake. t's likely that you will pay significantly more for an armed guard than for one who isn't armed. The armed officers will also cost a little bit more because of the additional education and training they have received. If you are in a region that requires armed security, the cost can be justified.

Some companies that are not in high-risk locations opt not to hire armed guards because they believe it would add to the risk. A security guard will frequently need to be armed if they are defending a priceless object. The requirement for an armed guard rises when there is a significant likelihood that anything will be stolen.
