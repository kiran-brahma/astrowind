For commercial property or community security, a mobile security patrol can be beneficial. With many staff, customers, and residents coming and going, monitoring is needed to detect suspicious behaviour and reduce security risks.

Mobile patrols can deter intruders and monitor the environment. They also provide prompt alarm responses. Lock-up/unlock services and staff escorts are available.

## Choosing the Right Patrols[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#choosing-the-right-patrols)

When valuable assets or community safety are at stake, it's essential to pick the right mobile patrol provider. The wrong choice can put your business in danger. Here's how to make sure you engage the right service.

## Licenses & Regulations[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#licenses--regulations)

The company and its personnel must obey the law and possess proper licenses and training. Security is not the place to take shortcuts.

## Monitoring Activity[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#monitoring-activity)

The provider should have regular contact with patrol officers. Poor communication can leave businesses and staff vulnerable, so make sure regular communication is set up with a control room or monitoring station, allowing 24-hour surveillance and monitoring.

## Reporting & Recording[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#reporting--recording)

Look for automated reporting and recording to prevent human errors and keep all data easily accessible.

## Uniforms[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#uniforms)

Security officers should have properly labelled uniforms to distinguish them from customers and staff. Uniforms marked with the business name, not just plain uniforms, can prevent imitation and protect important data and assets.

## Registered & Marked Patrol Vehicles[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#registered--marked-patrol-vehicles)

Vehicles should have visible markings and be registered and licensed. Unmarked vehicles may suggest the business is not accredited and not implementing effective security. Marked patrols can also act as a deterrent.

## Finances, Payments, & Taxes[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#finances-payments--taxes)

Ensure the business is registered and provides valid GST invoices. Organizations that evade payment of GSTIN or other labour compliance are not reliable and lack the credibility to offer services.

## Staff Training[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security-agency-tips#staff-training)

Patrols should receive the appropriate training and ongoing training as the security industry evolves. This leads to skilled patrols and increased staff engagement.
