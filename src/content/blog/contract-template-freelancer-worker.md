## Key Elements of Contract Agreement

- Hiring Duration of the Employee
- Employee Details: Name, Contact and other personnel details that is needed
- Role and responsibilities to be handled by the employee. Typically you hire for a project, so you need to explain within the confines of the project
- Compensation Details: Details of the wages paid, payment frequency and billing process that the employee needs to adopt during the contract period
- Assets: In case any company assets such as Mobile or laptop are provided, you detail them to ensure that in case of any damages, the expenses can be calculated accordingly. You can even choose that the employee is responsible for using his/her assets for the project and the Company will not provide them if needed. However, it is recommended to issue Company assets if the employee will be working on critical projects to ensure data security
- Expenses: Details of the expenses reimbursement process when the employee engages in his role
- Non-Disclosure Agreement: Both the contractor and the service provider agree to keep company information confidential
- Intellectual property rights: Ownership and rights of the product and service rendered by the employee have to be specified. It needs to clarify who owns what to avoid future conflicts
- Termination: Explain the details of when and how the contract can be terminated in case of any changes in the project or you don';'t find the employee meeting your needs as expected
- Right to the injunction: This means that both the parties (contract employee and organisation) acknowledge giving a special value to the services rendered, which cannot be compensated by damages in any action of law. It can’t also be breached by the employee
- Benefits details: Any specific benefits that you might wish to provide to the employee
- Conflict Resolution: The employee must enter the agreement in free will and it should not conflict with any other agreement between the employee and any other third party. You can also state if the employee is free to engage with other companies or needs to work on an exclusive basis when the contract is effective
