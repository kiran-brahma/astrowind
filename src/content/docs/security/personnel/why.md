Personnel security helps protect your people, information, and assets by allowing your organization to:

- Reduce the risk of harm to your personnel, customers, and partners
- Lower the risk of your information or assets being lost, damaged, or compromised
- Increase trust in people who access important information and assets
- Deliver services and operate more efficiently.

## Insider Threats

Insider threats come from current or former employees, contractors, or business partners. They can misuse their insider knowledge or access to injure your personnel, customers, assets, or reputation. Personnel security focuses on reducing the risks associated with insider threats.

An “insider threat” or “insider” is anyone who exploits, or plans to exploit, their legitimate access to an organization’s assets to harm their organization’s, knowingly or unknowingly, through espionage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure of information, or loss or degradation of a resource (or capability).

Common insider acts include:

- Unauthorized disclosure of official, private, or proprietary information
- Fraud or process corruption
- Unauthorized access to ICT systems
- Economic or industrial espionage
- Theft
- Violence or physical harm to others.

Many security breaches are unintentional and result from a lack of awareness or focus on security practices, being distracted, or being tricked into unknowingly helping a third party.
