Construction sites are susceptible to burglary. Valuable items like copper, tools, machinery, batteries, fuel, and even work vehicles can all be targeted. Having worked in construction for over five years, I've seen theft resulting in financial loss and decreased productivity due to missing materials.

This shows that the thieves' tactics are both well practiced and brazen, and that good fencing, bright lighting, CCTV coverage, or security patrols in isolation are not enough to deter or defeat them. What you need is an 'integrated' approach that uses a combination of security measures.

These measures include:

* Plans & Procedures
    
* Physical Barriers
    
* Technology
    
* People
    

## Plans & Procedures[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/construction#plans--procedures)

Having plans and procedures for security, just like for Health & Safety, is essential. They help ensure everyone is on the same page in terms of protecting themselves and their equipment. Preparation is key here, as 'preparation prevents poor performance'.

## Physical Barriers[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/construction#physical-barriers)

Perimeter fences, gates, and cages are the most visible signs of security. They can be a good deterrent, but they need to be kept in good condition and the gates should be secured. Additionally, thieves tend to avoid places they can be seen, so good lighting is also useful.

## **Technology**[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/construction#technology)

Security technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, alarms, CCTV, access control, and visitor management systems, can be effective - especially when monitored. To ensure larger areas are covered more effectively, a 24/7 remote monitoring team should be put in place.

## **People**[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/construction#people)

Security personnel are an important part of the integrated security solution. They can provide static guarding, mobile patrols, alarm monitoring and response, and incident response services.
