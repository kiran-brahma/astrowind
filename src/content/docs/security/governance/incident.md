# Incident Reporting and Security Investigations

Understand how Knighthood reports, manages, and investigates security incidents using a consistent and structured approach.

## Overview

A security incident is:

- A breach, infringement, or violation of protective security policy or procedure
- An approach from someone seeking unauthorized access to official resources
- An attempt to gain unauthorized access to official resources
- Any other event that could cause harm, or has caused harm, to the security of the Organisation, its premises, or projects

## Role

Knighthood will evaluate the impact of any security incident on our customers, whether actual, potential, or suspected.

Knighthood undertakes the following process:

- Identify if the incident is minor (infringement or breach) or major (violation, which must be reported)
- Report the incident to relevant government agencies if necessary

## Key Security Incidents

Knighthood will always report incidents such as:

- Theft, attempted theft, burglary, vandalism, fraud, or assault
- Fire, storm damage, or other natural events that could compromise security
- Misuse of information that is protectively marked.

## People and Tasks

Knighthood creates a policy for security incident reporting. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of those involved in security incidents and investigations.

### Project Head

Our Project Head will be responsible for establishing processes for staff, contractors, and their employees to report security incidents and keeping records of the organisationâ€™s security performance and requirements.

### Senior managers

Senior managers are responsible for the procedures for security incident reporting and recording in their areas and for the organization as a whole. The Chief Security Officer (CSO) or their delegate should provide assistance.

For security investigations, a senior manager, who is independent of the incident, should approve the terms of reference and objectives. They also receive regular reports on the progress of the investigation from Knighthood

### Managers

Managers should ensure security incidents are reported to the CSO or Knighthood and collaborate closely with them on any security concerns.

They are in a key position to spot security incidents or suspicious behavior, as they interact closely with staff.

### CSO

The CSO, or their delegate, receives and acts on security incident information. They should record the incidents and outcomes of investigations, and report regularly to senior management on security performance.

### Employees

All personnel of your organization must be acquainted with and adhere to the security incident reporting protocols.

Knighthood suggests offering security awareness training for employees, contractors, and their subordinates.
