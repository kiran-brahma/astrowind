At Knighthood, we provide a comprehensive range of VIP protection services that are tailored to the individual's needs. We understand that no two people are the same, and so we strive to ensure that our services are customised to meet the unique requirements of each individual. In order to guarantee the highest degree of security, we only employ the most reliable personnel who have been carefully vetted and trained by us. Our extensive background checks guarantee that our employees are capable of providing the highest standard of security. For those times when extra protection is necessary, we offer armed guards who are experienced and fully qualified to handle any situation.
