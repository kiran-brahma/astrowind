As an employer, you need to establish certain key policies before Payroll can be run. 

### Define Payroll Policy

It is the first step where you need to set the policies in place to process the payroll. 

The policies include:

 * *Attendance policy* 

 * *Pay policy*

 * *Leave and benefits policy*

 * *Monthly Pay Cycle*

 
To ensure smooth operations of Payroll, an organization needs to set a payroll policy and procedures to ensure all payment are made on time.

## Data Collection

In the next step you need to gather inputs from various departments to ensure accurate calculation of payroll. This can be a simple or a overwhelming process depending on your employee strength. You will need to adopt a Payroll Service to ensure that this is handled with ease

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EMPLOYEES            | PERSONAL DETAILS, BANKING DETAILS, INCOME TAX DECLARATION, BENEFITS AVAILED                      |
| HR                   | SALARY STRUCTURE, BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY                                                           |
| FINANCE              | REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES AND DEDUCTIONS IF ANY                                                  |
| LEAVE AND ATTENDANCE | LEAVE AND ATTENDANCE DATA OF EMPLOYEE                                                            |
| SERVICE PROVIDER     | DEDUCTION IF ANY FROM SERVICE PROVIDER FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO EMPLOYEE AND APPROVED BY COMPANY |

### Input validation

After all, information is gathered, then you need to verify its validity to ensure no errors creep into the payroll process

Basic Checks Include:

    * *Ensure that the list contains all the active employees and no records of inactive employees*

    * *Data adheres to the company policy*

    * *Validate if all data has been collected* 

    * *Data is in the correct format*
