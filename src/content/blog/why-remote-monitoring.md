Security is a major concern for any business as security failures lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and even legal consequences. Many businesses lack the resources or expertise to monitor and respond to security threats effectively on a real-time basis. Remote Monitoring aids in ensuring that security alerts are addressed on a real-time basis by business

## **What is Remote Monitoring?**

Remote monitoring is a service that allows trained personnel to monitor your security alerts raised by a video analytics system. The team then responds to the alerts by either dismissing them as false positives or involving local personnel to take further action.

## **Benefits**

### **Faster Response Time**

Trained Remote monitoring personnel are well-versed in detecting and responding to security within a moment’s notice. Remote monitoring teams are trained to identify security alerts and determine the best course of action. The staff further escalate the issues to local personnel or authorities as per requirement.

### **Security Threats Identification**

Remote monitoring helps in the improvement of the video analytics systems by identification of false positives. False positives are alerts that indicate a potential threat but are harmless. Remote monitoring teams are trained to filter out false positives and focus on the most relevant alerts. The feedback loop improves the overall analytics system

### **Cost Savings**

Remote monitoring can help you reduce your security expenses by reducing overall physical security personnel on your premises. Multiple activities undertaken by security staff will be taken up by the remote monitoring team with the aid of the video analytics system. You don't have to invest in hiring, training, or retaining your security staff for such activities. You only pay for the service every month, benefitting from the economies of scale.

## **How to Choose a Remote Monitoring Service Provider**

If you are interested in remote monitoring for your business, you need to choose a reliable and trustworthy service provider that can meet your needs and expectations. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a remote monitoring service provider:

### **Experience and Reputation**

Invest in engaging the services of a Security Agency that has been providing similar services to customers with similar profiles as yours

### **Scope and Quality of Service**

Look for a service provider that can offer a comprehensive and customized service that covers all aspects of remote monitoring and security. Check what types of alerts they can monitor, what tools and methods they use, how they respond to alerts, how they communicate with you, how they handle data privacy and security, how they measure and report their performance, and how they handle emergencies or contingencies.

### **Cost and Value**

Engage only with such service providers that offer a fair and transparent pricing model that suits your budget and needs. Check what services are included in the price, what are the additional or hidden fees, what are the payment terms and options, what are the guarantees or warranties, and what are the benefits or discounts they offer.

## **Conclusion**

Remote monitoring is a valuable service that can help businesses improve their security while reducing costs. By outsourcing the task of monitoring and responding to security alerts to trained personnel, businesses can benefit from faster response time, improved accuracy and reduced expenses. Businesses need to choose a reliable and trustworthy service provider that can offer a comprehensive and customised service that meets their needs and expectations.
