alt="Common Mistakes"/>



### Hiring Untrained or Unqualified Guards

 Ensure that the security guards you hire are properly [trained and certified](/blog/security-guard). In India, the Supreme Court has set guidelines for security companies, including a minimum of 100 hours of classroom teaching and 60 hours of field training for their staff.

### Not Conducting a Background Check
 [Verify the background](/blog/employee-verification) of the security company and the guards they provide. This includes checking for criminal records and ensuring that they have no history of dishonest activities.

### Not Considering Customized Solutions
 Each business has unique security needs. Ensure that the security company you hire is willing to adapt their services to meet your specific requirements

### Not Focusing on Prevention
 [Prevention is critical to effective security](https://docs.knighthood.co/security/governance/develop). Ensure that the security company you hire is proactive in their approach and [provides strategies](https://docs.knighthood.co/security/measures/planning) for preventing crime, rather than just reacting to incidents

### Not Checking Reputation and Licensing
 Research the security company's reputation by reading reviews and checking their ratings on platforms. Also, ensure that they have the [necessary licenses and insurance coverage](https://docs.knighthood.co/security/personnel/guard) for their services

### Not Negotiating Contract Terms and Pricing
 Carefully review the [contract terms and pricing structure](/blog/our-pricing) of the security company. Negotiate the terms to ensure they meet your business needs, and consider factors such as [labour compliance](https://docs.knighthood.co/docs/intro)

### Not Ensuring Uniform Options
Ensure that the [security guards you hire](https://docs.knighthood.co/security/personnel/types) are uniformed in a way that aligns with your business's image and needs. This can include police-style uniforms, suits, or plain clothes, depending on the security duties

### Not Hiring from a Reputable Agency
Hiring from a reputable agency can provide peace of mind and ensure that the guards are [professionally trained and equipped](https://docs.knighthood.co/security/governance/awareness) to perform their duties

### Not Asking Questions
 Don't hesitate to ask questions about the services offered, the training provided, and the experience of the security guards. This will help you make an informed decision about the security company you choose
