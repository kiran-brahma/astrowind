Video analytics is a modern technology that involves using computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from video data. It has numerous applications, including security, surveillance, traffic management, retail, sports, and entertainment. By leveraging video analytics, businesses can improve their efficiency, customer safety, experience, and decision-making capabilities.

Thanks to recent advances in technology, video analytics can now detect and track objects, recognize faces, and analyze behavior in real-time. This has made it particularly useful for enhancing security measures in various industries, including retail stores, remote locations, restricted zones, perimeter monitoring, and fire and safety hazard notifications.

At Knighthood, we collaborate with [Staqu](https://www.staqu.com), who provides us with their comprehensive video analytics platform. We use this platform to develop modern security solutions that supplement traditional physical security measures at customer premises. As a result, we offer the most cost-effective security solutions across a wide range of industries.
