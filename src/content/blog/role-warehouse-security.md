A warehouse is an important place where you store essential items for your business. Large companies that produce daily essentials rely on their warehouses to store their products, so they must be secured and well-maintained.

Here are the key responsibilities of [security guards](http://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/static-guarding) for your warehouse:

## Respond Quickly to Any Incident[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/role-warehouse-security#respond-quickly-to-any-incident)

Security guards in your warehouse can detect a problem right away and make a report if there’s a leak in your pipes, [fire, or any other incident](http://knighthood.co/services/Security/iss/fire). Trained security guards can also act quickly when accidents happen to your employees.

## Protect the Employees[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/role-warehouse-security#protect-the-employees)

Every member of your staff needs protection inside the warehouse. Security guards will consider the employees as their priority to protect. They will not only protect them but also make sure that they are following the company’s guidelines by checking their ID or if they are wearing the proper attire for work.

## Check the Inventories[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/role-warehouse-security#check-the-inventories)

Security guards must monitor every item in the warehouse to ensure that all of them are complete and in good condition. Every closing hour, they do rounds to check for further safety of the entire warehouse.

## Prevent Theft[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/role-warehouse-security#prevent-theft)

Warehouses are one of the most targeted places by thieves, so security guards need to implement a protocol to avoid theft in the area. Security guards have to do security scanning and check each of them and if they are hiding the items from the warehouse. Well-trained security guards can stop outsiders from entering the warehouse. Once the thieves are caught, they will report it to you immediately and to the police officers.

## All-Around Monitoring[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/role-warehouse-security#all-around-monitoring)

Security guards should [roam](http://knighthood.co/services/Security/iss/patrol) around the whole area to ensure the security of the place. And if you have visitors in your warehouse, security guards also have to make them log in a logbook, so that the name and time of arrival and departure of the visitor will be recorded. They also have to check the IDs of the delivery drivers and vendors for credentials to avoid trespassers.

Security guards must be knowledgeable about a high-tech security system because [CCTVs and alarm systems](http://localhost:3000/services/security/ess/cctv) are all essential for the whole facility. [Emergency response](http://knighthood.co/services/Security/iss/emergency) will be faster if both security guards and a high-tech security system work well together.
