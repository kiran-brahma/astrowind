## Astute Detection Systems

Did you know that our camera solutions are more than just surveillance tools? By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and intelligent video analytics, we can fine-tune your CCTV system to proactively identify potential security risks and help you better understand your customers.

## Remote Video Analytics Solutions

Burglars are determined, and a sounding alarm may not be enough to deter them. Our remote security services provide extra protection.

Our services enable 24/7 monitoring on and around your business premises, giving you peace of mind.

### Alarm Monitoring

Our alarm monitoring service ensures 24/7 security of your premises. When an alarm is triggered, our Knighthood Operations Centre is alerted immediately and takes action. In the event of a critical situation, our team connects with your security team, keyholders, and emergency services, if necessary.

### Alarm Response

Our team is highly trained and experienced in responding to alarm activations quickly and efficiently. When an incident occurs, we send a staff member to your site to investigate the cause, removing the risk and hassle from you and your keyholders. You can trust us to respond promptly and appropriately to any alarm activations. Our staff are knowledgeable in security procedures and are committed to providing a reliable and secure service to all our clients..

### Remote Video Solutions

Knighthood runs a fully-managed central operations team to help prevent incidents. Our operators provide proactive features, such as alarm verification (remotely monitoring cameras when alarms are received), audio warnings (to deter intruders), and more.

Our teams are available 24/7 to patrol the premises as needed, providing a physical presence and acting as a deterrent. In the event of an emergency, we will contact the relevant authorities while our on-ground personnel provide assistance.
