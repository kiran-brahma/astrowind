Knighthood analyzes your organization's unique context and potential threats to determine the necessary physical security measures. We take a risk-based approach, ensuring the measures implemented are suitable for your organization.

## Identification
We identify the people, information, physical assets, and functions that need protection, then determine the threats facing your organization. We understand the value and sensitivity of your information and assets to accurately assess physical security risks.

## Assessment 
Using [Business Impact Levels (BILs)](/security/governance/bil), we assess the potential impact if people, information, or assets were harmed, compromised, or unavailable. For example:

- Customers being aggressive to personnelÂ¯
- Property theft
- Tampering of security system and unauthorized office access out of hours
- Unauthorized access to premises and theft of valuable information

For each threat scenario, we consider risks to:

- The public
- Personnel, property, operations, reputation, finances, or business processes
