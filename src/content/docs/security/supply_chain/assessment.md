|        You assess risks and figure out what security measures are needed to reduce   them. You put these security expectations in your agreements with suppliers.   These security expectations become the minimum requirements. 	|        You do not set up minimum security requirements, leaving it to your suppliers   to decide what to do. This may be because they do not have the knowledge to   know what is needed or how to do it properly. Alternatively, you may set   minimum security requirements, but these may not be suitable for your   suppliers to meet. 	|
