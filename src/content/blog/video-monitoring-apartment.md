Apartment complexes face unique security challenges due to the high number of residents, visitors, and common areas. [Video monitoring systems](https://blog.knighthood.co/whyremotemonitoring) can provide an effective solution by deterring crime, improving response times, and giving residents peace of mind.

## Key Benefits

### **Crime Prevention and Deterrence**

The most significant benefit of video monitoring is crime prevention. Simply having visible cameras around an apartment complex can deter much criminal activity. Would-be intruders are less likely to target a property that is under video surveillance. According to the National Apartment Association, up to 90% of crimes at apartment complexes are prevented due to the presence of security cameras.

Video monitoring operators can also actively deter crime as it happens. When the operators notice suspicious activity, they can issue warnings over the camera speaker system or directly contact the individuals. In many cases, this is enough to stop criminal behaviour before any damage or theft occurs.

### **Improved Incident Response**

With live video feeds, property managers and emergency services have real-time visibility of the entire complex. If an incident does occur, video monitoring operators can quickly notify management and the authorities. This significantly improves response times, which is critical during emergencies.

For example, if there is a fire in a unit, video monitoring operators will see the smoke and flames immediately and call 101. They can then notify building management and provide updates to first responders until they arrive on the scene. The faster response time could mean the difference between a contained fire and a full building evacuation.

### **Evidence Gathering and Investigation**

Video footage from surveillance cameras provides irrefutable evidence that can be used to identify, investigate, and prosecute offenders. In the event of a crime like theft, vandalism, or assault, video monitoring operators can save the relevant footage and provide it to law enforcement.

With clear video and audio recordings, police have a much higher chance of identifying and apprehending suspects. The footage can also be used as evidence in insurance claims and legal proceedings.

### **Increased Peace of Mind for Residents**

For apartment residents, simply knowing that common areas are under video surveillance provides a greater sense of safety and security. Tenants can come and go, use amenities, and park their vehicles with less worry about crime and intruders.

Property managers can also highlight the video monitoring system as a value-added security feature to attract and retain residents. Potential tenants may choose one apartment complex over another specifically because of the video surveillance system.

### **Other Benefits**

Beyond the main benefits above, video monitoring systems can also help with visitor logging, property inspections, and tenant screening. Video footage from applicant interviews can verify the information and identify red flags before leasing to high-risk individuals. During severe weather events, video monitoring operators can notify residents of imminent dangers.

Overall, video monitoring systems provide around-the-clock security oversight that property managers cannot reasonably achieve on their own. The combination of camera deterrence, rapid incident response, evidence gathering, and increased peace of mind make video surveillance an effective tool for enhancing security at apartment complexes.
