Never overlook the security of a business, organization, or premises. Taking site security seriously can provide numerous ongoing benefits, including a reduced rate of targeting from criminals, improved business efficiency, and long-term cost reduction.

Most of us understand what a security system is and its importance. However, did you know that remote security monitoring is an additional security service that can maximize the benefits of your current security system and add an extra layer of protection to both the premises and employees?

## What is remote security monitoring?[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#what-is-remote-security-monitoring)

Remote security monitoring is the 24/7, year-round monitoring of an entire security system by a third-party provider. The monitoring team is responsible for monitoring several factors, with the most important being activated alarms, such as intruder alarms, sensors, and/or CCTV cameras.

When an alarm is triggered, the remote security monitoring team takes action and informs the police or relevant authorities. This puts the responsibility of managing, worrying about, and dealing with a business' security system onto the remote security monitoring provider and not on the business or installer, providing total peace of mind.

## How does remote monitoring work?[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#how-does-remote-monitoring-work)

Curious about how remote monitoring works, especially when conducted remotely? Let us help you understand.

The remote security monitoring company you select will have its Monitoring centre. This centre is staffed around the clock by a team of highly trained operatives. The Centre receives signals from any triggered alarms or cameras, alerting the operatives to a security breach.

The monitoring operatives will then act quickly to determine the most appropriate response to the situation, whether it be contacting the police or connecting with the local security personnel or triggering a remote alarm. The entire process, from receiving the alarm notification to initiating an immediate response is usually completed within a few minutes, ensuring that optimal action is taken before it’s too late

## What happens if an alarm is triggered?[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#what-happens-if-an-alarm-is-triggered)

When an alarm is triggered, a swift response to the security emergency is ensured by carrying out several steps. Upon receiving the alarm notification, the monitoring operatives will take the following steps:

### Confirm whether it is a false alarm.[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#confirm-whether-it-is-a-false-alarm)

The operatives acknowledge the possibility of a false alarm, especially during working hours. Therefore, they undertake the following steps

* Review the video for the trigger and validate if its genuine or false alarm
    
* If video indicates a security or safety concern, local security personnel are contacted to undertake a physical review
    

### Initiate an immediate response.[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#initiate-an-immediate-response)

At Knighthood before setting up the remote monitoring process, we discuss with our customers all response options available for the monitoring operatives. The most common options include:

* Contact Local Security personnel
    
* Trigger a remote alarm to scare the intruder
    
* Contact specific personnel from the customer’s team if required
    
* Contact with local police authorities
    

The remote security monitoring team is trained to choose the most appropriate response and carry it out instantaneously, ensuring that no safety or security incident occurs.

## Remote security monitoring cost[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#remote-security-monitoring-cost)

You need to account for the following expenses:

* **One Time Expenses**
    
    * IP-Enabled CCTV Camera
        
* **Monthly Recurring Expenses**
    
    * Dedicated Internet: 1 MBPS required per camera
        
    * Cloud Hosting and Operations Expenses
        
    * Cloud Storage Cost
        
    * Analytics Software Subscription Charges
        
    * Remote Monitoring Subscription
        

You can expect to spend around **₹12,500** for an IP-based camera. Monthly expenses will be around **₹2,000 to ₹4,000** per camera, depending on the features chosen and other service needs of your company. You will also need to account for Internet expenses, which should cost around ₹300 per camera.

Assuming a 3-year life for the CCTV, you will need to budget between **₹2,700 to ₹5,000** for enabling remote monitoring on your premises.

If you are concerned about privacy, you can choose to host the monitoring software and monitoring team on your premises. However, this option costs more than shared resources, which are based on a monthly subscription charge.

Keep in mind that the unit costs tend to fall as the number of cameras increases, so it makes sense to negotiate with a single vendor for all locations to optimize costs.

## Benefits of remote security monitoring[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#benefits-of-remote-security-monitoring)

There are numerous benefits to having a professional remote security monitoring company oversee your security system.

### Extra Layer of Protection[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#extra-layer-of-protection)

Remote security monitoring provides additional security for the site and better building protection against break-ins.

### Reduction in Security Expenses[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#reduction-in-security-expenses)

Without CCTV coverage in your premises, you need to provide physical security in all risk zones for optimal coverage. However, by using remote monitoring, you can outsource many physical security tasks. This means that security personnel only need to be stationed at key locations and as a response team for threats identified by the remote monitoring team. Most organizations can reduce their manpower by up to 50%, leading to significant savings.

### Reduced Risk to Employees and Visitors[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#reduced-risk-to-employees-and-visitors)

Intruders and criminals pose a risk to individuals who may get in the way of their crimes. Remote security monitoring can help prevent criminal activity from escalating and putting your employees and visitors at risk.

### Immediate Response to Alarms[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#immediate-response-to-alarms)

Remote monitoring executives are provided with appropriate training, allowing them to respond quickly and efficiently to triggers raised by the Analytics software. They can provide a much faster response than another individual could.

### **Reduce Business Downtime**[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#reduce-business-downtime)

With remote monitoring in place, employees aren't responsible for security system activations. This reduces business downtime if an intruder breaks into the premises, as employees won't have to deal with the issue, driving better business efficiencies.

### Reduce Unwanted False Alarms[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/remote-monitoring#reduce-unwanted-false-alarms)

False alarms are not only annoying for businesses, but they also put a strain on emergency services. Remote security monitoring ensures that only real alarm activations are acted upon, saving all parties valuable time and money.

Remote security monitoring is an additional service that can increase the overall safety and security of a site while improving day-to-day efficiencies and business operations. With this service, employees can fully focus on their roles and not worry about potential intruders entering the premises, especially outside of regular business hours.
