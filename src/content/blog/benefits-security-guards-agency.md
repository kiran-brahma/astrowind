## Introduction

While [security guards](/blog/security-guard-types) play an important role in keeping places safe, choosing the right security company is essential for ensuring your guards are effective. The company you partner with can make or break your security program.

Many security companies exist but you should consider more than just pricing when selecting one:

* Reliability
* Experience
* Training standards
* Service quality
* [Systematic Process](/docs/security)
All the above factors play a key role to see if the service is truly value for money. 
Guards engaged directly or from agencies without clear professional credibility may be cheaper guards but they lack proper training, costing you more in losses from theft, vandalism and crime over time.

## Why Professional Security Guards

Professional guards do much more than regular security guards. They undergo comprehensive training to handle any situation from theft and assaults to disputes, medical emergencies and fires. They patrol designated areas, monitor premises 24/7 and may use weapons to enhance security.

As awareness of security needs grows, so does the demand for professional guards. However, not all companies can deliver high-quality services. Many lack the proper processes, guard training and experience required to effectively secure premises.

A reliable security company has a clear and robust security process that its guards follow consistently across locations. The guards are hardworking, determined and receive ongoing refresher training. The company offers a wide range of security and facility management services beyond just guards like CCTV, access control, alarm monitoring and more.  

While technology like [CCTV](/services/security/ess/cctv) assists, well-trained security guards remain essential. Proper training, skills, experience and tools enable guards to prevent and respond to incidents effectively. Untrained guards relying solely on technology often fail to identify and resolve issues before they escalate.
