## Current Scenario
![Retail Analytics](/retailai.jpg)
- It's nearly impossible to manually monitor hundreds of CCTV cameras across multiple screens 24x7. Even if someone tries to identify suspicious activity, it could result in unusual delays.
- Most retail facilities use CCTVs to monitor their premises, but they aren't maximizing their video surveillance investments. Automating various business processes could increase their ROI.
- Existing VMS used for CCTV monitoring aren't very intelligent, and in some cases, the lack of centralized monitoring and remote access prevents them from taking proactive actions in case of a breach.


## Video Analytics 

Video analytics enables quick response for certain actions within a store on a priority basis, without concerns about late or no response for key safety and security aspects within your retail store operations.
A central monitoring team coordinates with local security or store personnel to ensure quick action is taken. Every alert is logged, allowing customers to review them later and make appropriate changes to their current responses if needed with ease.
