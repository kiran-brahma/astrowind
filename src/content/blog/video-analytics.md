## Video Analytics[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video-analytics#video-analytics)

The process of gathering, analysing, and interpreting data from video streams is known as video analytics. It involves using artificial intelligence and machine vision to identify, track, and analyse people, objects, and activities in video streams. This data enables organisations to gain greater insight into their environment which can be employed to inform real-time or post-event decisions. Video analytics can be widely used for a variety of security purposes, including detecting intruders and monitoring for safety infractions.

With the advancement of technology, video analytics has become the latest tool for providing security solutions. It is a powerful technique that combines computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify, track, and analyse objects in video streams. In this blog post, we will discuss how video analytics is enabling new-age security solutions.
