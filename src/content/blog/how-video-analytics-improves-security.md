## **What is Video Analytics?**[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/improve_security#what-is-video-analytics)

Video analytics is a technology that processes digital video signals using special algorithms to perform security-related functions. There are three common types of video analytics:

* Artificial intelligence learning algorithms
    
* Fixed algorithm analytics
    
* Facial recognition systems
    

Here are some of the common applications of video analytics for security:

* **People Detection**: Video analytics detects and counts people in a video, their location, direction, and behaviour. You can easily monitor crowd density, occupancy levels, traffic flow, and suspicious activities.
    
* **Vehicle Detection**: Video analytics detects and classifies vehicles in a video, such as cars, trucks, buses, bikes, etc including their Vehicle Number. You can use the information gathered to monitor traffic patterns, parking violations, vehicle theft, and unauthorized access.
    
* **Object Detection**: Video analytics detects and recognizes specific objects in a video, such as weapons, bags, packages, etc. This information assists in the prevention of theft, vandalism or any other security incidents
    
* **Face Recognition**: Video analytics identifies and verifies faces in a video, age range, gender, etc. You can use this to authenticate users, identify frequent customers, grant secure access, detect intruders, and personalize specific services.
    

## Safety and Security[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/improve_security#safety-and-security)

* **Reduce False Alarms**: Video analytics filters out false alarms triggered by irrelevant motions and noises such as shadows, raindrops, or animals, saving time and preventing unnecessary panic.
    
* **Increasing Situational Awareness**: Video analytics provides real-time alerts and notifications to security staff when an event of interest occurs, such as a trespasser, a fire, a fight, etc. The local team can be provided with information immediately and respond quickly to mitigate any security or safety situation.
    
* **Generating Valuable Insights**: You can analyze data, generating reports and dashboards that show trends, patterns, anomalies, and statistics. Using the information and reports, you can understand your security performance and identify areas for improvement.
    

## Benefits of Video Analytics[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/improve_security#benefits-of-video-analytics)

Video analytics provides various benefits for businesses across different industries and sectors, such as:

* [**Retail**](http://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/video_analytics/retail): Video analytics helps retailers prevent shoplifting, optimize store layout, measure customer satisfaction, and personalize marketing campaigns.
    
* **Warehouse**: Video analytics can keep complete track of all movements by persons and vehicles within your premises, allowing you to detect security incidents with ease
    
* **Education**: Video analytics aids schools and universities in student safety, and attendance, identifying bad behaviour, thereby enhancing learning outcomes.
    
* **Hospitality**: Video analytics helps hotels and restaurants prevent theft or fraud by staff or guests, enhance guest experience, measure customer feedback, and optimize operations.
    

## Getting Started with Video Analytics[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/improve_security#getting-started-with-video-analytics)

To get started with video analytics, you need three main components:

* **Video Sources**: These are the cameras that capture the video footage. You need Digital cameras with good quality, resolution, coverage, and connectivity (1 MBPS per camera ).
    
* **Video Management System (VMS)**: This is the software that stores, manages, and displays video footage. It can be cloud-based or on-premise, depending on your needs and preferences. You need to ensure that your VMS is compatible with your cameras, scalable, secure, and user-friendly.
    
* **Video Analytics Software**: Software that analyzes the video footage, providing you with the information needed. It can be integrated with your VMS or run separately, depending on your requirements.
