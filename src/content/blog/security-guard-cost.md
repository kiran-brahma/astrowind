## How Much Does it Cost to Hire a Security Guard in India?[
Typically, security guards in India are paid around Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 27,000 per month, depending on the region and the experience of the guard. For example, a guard in Delhi is paid an average of Rs. 18,000 per month, while in Bangalore, the average salary is Rs. 15,000 per month. This means that the cost of hiring a security guard varies significantly across different cities in India.

One should be aware of all the cost components that need to be considered when engaging with any agency before hiring a Security Guard or for that matter any blue-collared employee. [This post](/blog/our-pricing) explains all the cost elements that one needs to be aware of to be fully compliant with current labour law regulations across India.

If you are looking to hire a security guard for an event, you should know that the cost of hiring a security guard in metropolitan cities can be quite high. For instance, in Delhi, the cost of hiring a security guard for an event can be anywhere from Rs. 18,000 to Rs. 33,000, depending on the purpose and duration of the event. Similarly, in Bangalore, the cost can range from Rs. 17,000 to Rs. 30,000. Additionally, the cost of hiring a security guard in Mumbai may be even higher, ranging from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000.

Overall, when it comes to hiring a security guard in India, the cost can vary significantly depending on the region and the purpose of the event. It is important to do your research and compare different services before making a decision.
## Affordability

The aim isn't solely to opt for a low-cost security company but rather to identify a reasonably priced option. A security company that overcharges compared to the market norm is unlikely to gain favour with most organisations. Nevertheless, this doesn't imply a search for the lowest-cost agency.

It's imperative to factor in government regulations encompassing [minimum wages](/docs/Compliance/Min-Wages), [PF](/docs/Compliance/EPF), [ESIC](/docs/Compliance/ESI), [bonuses](/docs/Compliance/Bonus), and other [statutory obligations](/docs/Compliance/Introduction) when gauging the cost of hiring a security guard.

Once the baseline cost is established, scrutinise the supplementary fees levied by the agency for their services. Survey the market to comprehend the general inclusions in security services provided by most vendors. Additionally, consider the agency's market experience, supplementary benefits, and the expertise of their professionals.
