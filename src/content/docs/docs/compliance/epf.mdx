The Provident Fund is a welfare scheme for the benefits of the employees. Both employer and employee contribute their share of the amount, but the whole of the amount is deposited by the employer. The employer deducts the employee share from the salary of the employee. So, the accumulated amount can be withdrawn if certain conditions are met. Employees Provident Fund was established in the year 1952.
  
  ## Scheme Functioning ###

  Under the EPF scheme, employers and employees both contribute to the EPF account every month. However, it is the responsibility of the employer to deposit the entire amount in the EPF account. The employee's EPF share is deducted from their monthly salary.
  
  For all EPF transfers, an employee needs to have  a UAN(Universal Account Number), which is issued by EPFO. The UAN is allotted to an individual under which an employer makes all necessary payments. Its mandatory to have Aadhar linked with UAN, else no payments are possible.

## Applicability of the EPF Act

It is  mandatory for all organizations that have employed a minimum of 20 employees. Within one month of attaining the employee strength, an employer has to register with EPF.

If when employee strength of a registered establishment falls below 20, the act is applicable. Once a firm is registered, the EPF act will be active irrespective of employee strength

Organizations with less than 20 employees can also avail of voluntary registration. All the employees from the beginning of their employment will be eligible for EPF.

# EPF Objectives

* Compliance must be facilitated easily.
* Make sure organisations follow all the rules and regulations set up by the EPFO on a regular basis.

## Universal Account Number (UAN)
All subscribers of EPF can access their PF accounts online and perform functions like withdrawal and checking EPF balance. The Universal Account Number (UAN) makes it convenient to login to the EPFO member portal.

The UAN is a 12-digit number alloted to each member by EPFO. The UAN of an employee remains the same even after he/she switches jobs. In the event of a job change, the member ID changes, and the new ID will be linked to the UAN. However, employees must activate their UAN in order to avail the services online.

You can get your UAN through your employer. In case you are unable to do so, you can easily login to the [UAN portal](https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/) with your member ID and find the UAN.
