Warehouse security is an essential aspect of running a successful business. Theft and fraud can cause significant financial losses and damage to your reputation. In this blog post, we are sharing the key threats to warehouse security

There are four primary areas that can cause financial loss to warehouse businesses due to crime. Let's take a closer look at each of these areas.

## Employee Theft[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/threat-warehouse#employee-theft)

Employee theft is the primary reason warehouses lose money. It can range from petty theft, where employees help themselves to the occasional "treat," to employee-orchestrated mass theft and fraud. Without robust [security policies](https://knighthood.co/security/measures/physical) to manage it, employee theft can easily go undetected. It is widely thought that the real statistics are underreported.

## Theft of Cargo in Transit[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/threat-warehouse#theft-of-cargo-in-transit)

Goods in transit are vulnerable to theft, and it is not unusual for a lorry in India to be transporting cargo worth lakhs of goods. Crime gangs take advantage of transport security vulnerabilities every day.

## Walk-in Theft and Burglary[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/threat-warehouse#walk-in-theft-and-burglary)

When a business does not keep meticulous track of its entryways and exits or monitor and check the credentials of staff and visitors entering and leaving the premises, it's easy for a walk-in thief to take advantage of the busy environment and take off with a serious haul of valuable goods.

## Administrative and Staffing Security[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/threat-warehouse#administrative-and-staffing-security)

Many aspects of your administrative system are incredibly important to the overall security of your warehouse. Some relatively minor changes can bring a lot of benefits. For example, recruiting the right people, providing robust induction and training, monitoring inventory management, and implementing a robust visitor policy can all contribute to reducing losses due to theft.
