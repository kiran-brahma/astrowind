## Classification Framework

Knighthood has developed a framework for assessing the potential harm if any information or facility is compromised, and defines the minimum requirements for protection.

Classification is the practice of assessing the sensitivity of the issue at hand and the likely harm that would result from the current situation. There are two types of situations that can occur:

- Situations that would cause only minimal harm if compromised and do not need special security or handling beyond the standard protections that currently apply. This is called "unclassified information."
- Situations that would cause harm to individuals or customer interests if compromised and require specific security measures to reduce the impact. This is called "classified information."

Please note that classification is a point-in-time risk assessment made by Knighthood based on the information available at the time.

## Why is classification important?

Classification helps to keep our customers' premises and information secure. Protective markings are a reminder of the sensitivity of the information or equipment and the security measures and special handling requirements that apply to it.
