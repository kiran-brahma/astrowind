Security solutions for individual house-owners provide the same level of protection and peace of mind as those found in gated communities and apartment complexes. 
With the right combination of patrolling manpower, alarms, motion sensors, and security cameras, homeowners can rest assured that their residence is safe and secure. 
The peace of mind that comes from knowing your home is protected from intruders or other potential dangers is priceless and can provide a sense of comfort and security 
in your own home.

We understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to security, and so we will work with you to identify the right combination of static guarding and electronic surveillance that will ensure Optimum Service Delivery at an economical cost. We are also proud to offer group-based security services to House-owners at a more economical cost than individual security solutions. These solutions include 

- Shared manned guarding

We take the time to thoroughly assess each client's needs and tailor our security services to best fit those requirements, ensuring that each customer receives the highest level of protection for their home or business.

By pooling the total cost among multiple homeowners, it means that individuals can benefit from reduced security expenses without any sacrifice in terms of the service they receive. This is a great way to give customers peace of mind knowing that their homes are safe and secure, all while enjoying lower costs.
