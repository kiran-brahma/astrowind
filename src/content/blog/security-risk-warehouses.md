## What Are Warehouse Security Risks?[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#what-are-warehouse-security-risks)

Warehouse [security risks](http://knighthood.co/security/lifecycle) are threats or hazards that can compromise the safety and integrity of your warehouse, assets, and employees. Some of the most common warehouse security risks are:

### Break-Ins[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#break-ins)

Unauthorized intruders can enter your warehouse and steal or damage your goods, equipment, or data. They can also harm your employees or disrupt your operations.

### Vandalism[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#vandalism)

Vandals can deface or destroy your property, such as walls, doors, windows, signs, vehicles, or machinery. This can affect your image, reputation, and functionality.

### [Fires](http://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/fire)[​](http://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/fire)

Fires can break out due to faulty wiring, flammable materials, arson, or accidents. Fires can cause severe damage to your warehouse and contents, as well as endanger the lives of your employees and firefighters.

### Internal Theft[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#internal-theft)

Internal theft occurs when your employees steal from your warehouse, either for personal gain or to sell to others. This can result in inventory shrinkage, revenue loss, and trust issues.

### External Theft[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#external-theft)

External theft occurs when someone outside of your organization steals from your warehouse, such as customers, suppliers, contractors, or competitors. This can result in inventory shrinkage, revenue loss, and legal problems.

### Employee Safety[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#employee-safety)

Ensure that your employees working in your warehouse are kept safe and feel protected. This means that your building should be secure and only accessible to staff members. If your warehouse is easily broken into or vandalized, it can lead to staff members feeling vulnerable.

### Health and Safety[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#health-and-safety)

Warehouses often hold large pieces of equipment such as forklifts, which, if used incorrectly, can impact health and safety. Even if all safety precautions are followed, accidents can still happen that can lead to your employees being injured.

### Flooding[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#flooding)

Flooding can cause significant damage to your business and warehouse. It can damage any stock you are holding and the infrastructure itself, which can be very costly. Flooding can occur due to poor weather or issues with plumbing.

### Access Issues[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/security-risk-warehouses#access-issues)

Consider who can access your warehouse and business, and how. Your business should be secure at all times, and employees who are allowed to access it should be given key cards or codes to enter the building. This ensures that no unauthorized individuals can enter your business. Unauthorized access to your site can be very risky.

### Lack of [CCTV](http://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)[​](http://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv)

One final danger to your warehouse and business is the lack of CCTV. CCTV protects your employees and can be used as evidence against any criminals who may try to infiltrate your warehouse. CCTV can often serve as a deterrent for many criminals.
