Ensuring the security of your warehouse is essential for any business. Here are six simple yet effective ways to enhance the safety and security of your warehouse.

## Upgrade Your Security Measures

Review the different types of warehouse [security measures](https://knighthood.co/security/measures/physical) and identify which ones your warehouse is currently using. Determine whether there are significant gaps and consider upgrading or adding new measures to improve overall security.

## Use Remote Camera Footage Backups

Consider using a service that backs up your security footage in real time for offsite storage. This way, thieves cannot destroy the footage by breaking into the security/AV room.

## Reinforce Entryways

Strong steel doors and locks are important, but reinforcing the doorframe is equally crucial for standard swing-style doors. Use strong deadbolts and long, high-durability door screws. For rolling doors, use high-strength locking mechanisms and thicker-gauge steel to prevent intrusion attempts. Reinforce windows and keep them locked when the warehouse is not in use. Rolling steel shutters can help secure windows and protect them during hurricane season.

## Make Security Checks a Part of Closing Procedures

For warehouses that are not open 24/7, have a set process for shutting the facility down at the end of the workday. Supervisors and/or security should check any security cages and locks to verify that they are secure, patrol the facility to check for open windows/skylights/doors, and ensure that the facility is empty before setting the alarm and leaving.

## Run Background Checks on All Warehouse Staff

Conduct [background checks](https://knighthood.co/services/verification) on employees to verify their trustworthiness, especially for those who will be handling small or high-value items frequently. This can help prevent internal theft.

## Outsource Distribution and Fulfillment to a Proven Partner

Consider outsourcing to a third-party logistics partner to save time and focus on developing your business, without worrying about specific fulfillment processes and warehouse management concerns.

By following these six practical tips, you can enhance the safety and security of your warehouse and protect your valuable inventory. It's important to conduct regular assessments of your security measures and make necessary improvements to keep your warehouse as safe as possible.
