Whether you are a corporate entity managing a large office complex, a retail store owner protecting valuable inventory, or a private individual concerned about the safety of your home and family, **armed PSO services** can provide the peace of mind you deserve.

## What are Armed PSO Services?

- **Access control:** PSOs can monitor and control access to your property, ensuring that only authorised individuals are allowed entry.
- **Deterrence:** The visible presence of armed PSOs can deter criminal activity and act as a psychological deterrent to potential intruders.
- **Patrol and surveillance:** PSOs can patrol your property on foot or by vehicle, and they can also use security cameras and other surveillance equipment to monitor for suspicious activity.
- **Response to incidents:** PSOs are trained to respond to a variety of security incidents, including theft, vandalism, and violence. They can also provide first aid and CPR in the event of an emergency.
