Warehouse security is crucial for any modern business that deals with hardware products. Typically, all hardware equipment and products are stored in warehouses, which are usually located farther away from where the distribution of the equipment takes place. Strong security measures for warehouses should be taken to deter theft or vandalism. Unfortunately, many people still neglect the simple steps involved in a security plan, and as a result, their company experiences major losses. In India, it is estimated that around 4% of all goods are lost due to poor security processes within their supply chains.

## Protecting Vulnerable Areas in a Warehouse[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-system#protecting-vulnerable-areas-in-a-warehouse)

Ensuring warehouse security means that you must cover all the spaces' vulnerable areas. Those include gates as well as warehouse doors. Make sure that your staff is trained to react quickly in the event of theft and that they're able to protect themselves. Warehouse theft prevention includes more than securing entrances and exits. It also involves protecting your inventory, including moving goods, machinery, and equipment. It's better to prevent theft than to deal with it; therefore, make sure you provide strong exterior gate management, a robust alarm system, appropriate landscaping, and reliable employee identification.

## Warehouse Theft Prevention Measures[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-system#warehouse-theft-prevention-measures)

To increase warehouse security, you can start by installing keyless access control. Your warehouse doors will have maximum protection due to state-of-the-art technology, and it can save you time granting and denying access in real time to different employees or deliverymen. You can send keys remotely so that you don't have to be on-site, and you can manage and track which doors are accessed at unattended locations. Access logs will be produced and can be retrieved automatically for each door, and the credentials of every person entering the facility will be recorded. You can also set up alerts to be notified when any of your locations are being unlocked, at what time, and by whom.

It's important to pick a suitable fire alarm, and most will integrate into your access control solution. It's recommended to integrate fire protection at the installation stage of your access system.

You should also pay attention to the IoT ecosystem and the technology that strengthens security. Physical access points are sensitive, but with the right systems in place, you won't encounter issues or barriers with them. Highly efficient burglar alarms will help boost your warehouse security.
