**Every business owner wants to know that their assets are secure, but how best to do it?**

Building and implementing a security framework that protects your business can be difficult due to the range of security options and each property's unique response. Fortunately, the process can be simplified by determining the kind of security staffing arrangement your property requires.

Static security personnel and mobile patrols both add a human element to your security framework but are suited to different areas and have unique operational requirements. To help you make a more informed choice, Knighthood has put together a few points to consider when making security staffing decisions for your business.

## Security Solutions for Different Situations[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/static-vs-patrol#security-solutions-for-different-situations)

Making the right security decision depends on understanding the individual needs of your property and how different security solutions can meet them. The security needs of a jewellery store are different from that of a warehouse or construction site. You need to take into account the following

* Your location
    
* Assets
    
* Business activities
    

The above influence the kind of threats you face and the security measures you need to take. It's important to consider the benefits of static security and mobile patrols.

Static security staff are the best option for places requiring continual monitoring of people or assets in a fixed area, such as for expensive items in a retail store or secure areas in a building.

Mobile patrols are better suited for larger or more widespread assets, such as those found in industrial premises or building sites. This doesn't mean they are of any less value; it's just that due to their size or design, they are harder to steal. For example, compare jewellery and cash to construction tools or commercial vehicles. As these items may be located in sizable areas, it can be too expensive or not possible to provide constant surveillance of all of them.

## Additional Services[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/static-vs-patrol#additional-services)

When considering a security staffing solution, it's important to consider how it fits into your overall operations. Focus to use the right security team to increase productivity and customer satisfaction.

Mobile patrols can do more than just protect assets. They can also carry out maintenance checks, report hazards, and submit reports during their shift. This helps to prevent vandalism and theft, as well as ensure employees are safe from malfunctioning equipment and workplace accidents.

Static security personnel are a great way to engage with customers. They can welcome clients into offices or buyers into stores, providing the information customers need to make decisions, as well as the protection your organization requires. Training may vary, but concierge security can act as receptionists, tour guides, retail assistants, and more, fitting into a variety of roles and corporate structures.

## Perception Matters[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/static-vs-patrol#perception-matters)

Businesses should consider how the choice of security personnel impacts public perception. Uniformed static security personnel can be seen as intimidating. Depending on the business, this can be beneficial or detrimental, either deterring customers or conveying to business partners that security is taken seriously. Alternatively, mobile patrols suggest efficiency and agility, showing the ability to respond to changing circumstances. When deciding on a security staffing solution, carefully consider how it will present your business.
