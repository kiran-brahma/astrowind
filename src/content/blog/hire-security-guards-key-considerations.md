Whether you've got a brand new facility opening up or just want to level up your current security, finding the right security agency is crucial. Within Delhi-NCR over 2100+ agencies are present with PSARA licenses and 40,000+ agencies across India that have the license. If we are to include those without one, the number will surely be 10X.

When presented with so many options, how do you sort the pros from the posers?

Hiring Security guards from an agency is not as simple as a picking a name out from a hat. You need to consider multiple factors such as:
- Experience
- Training Process
- Technology
- Prior Industry Exposure
& more


This blog post is written to provide you with the know-how to help you make a confident decision rather trying your luck across multiple agencies before finding the one that works best for you.

## The #1 Question: What's Their Reputation?

The very first question you need to ask is "Whats the Agency Reputation?". A lot of times, we just treat hiring security guards as some casual gig but fail to account for the fact that your primary objective is the safety of your people and protection of your assets



<Image className="mx-auto" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599508704512-2f19efd1e35f?q=80&w=2873&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="Key Question" width="400" height ="400" />

So do your homework. Scour online reviews (though lot can be fake to build up good reputation), talk to their existing customers within your network, their customer retention rates, reputation with the guards they employ.
Once you got a baselines established, connect with the agency. Don't be afraid to ask the tough questions during the initial stages itself. A truly standout agency will be transparent about their processes, experience, and track record.

Here are a few rep-checking tactics that can give you a good read on an agency:

- Ask for references and [case studies](/case)
- Check their citations and [accreditations](/services/security)
- Look at their [Customer Retention Rate](/whyus)

At the end of the day, investing in a seasoned, reputable security team with a proven track record is worth the effort and price. Do bear in mind that many agencies that offer rock-bottom price do so by not adhering to [Wages](/docs/Compliance/Min-Wages) and [Labour Compliance](/docs/Compliance/Introduction) as per government norms and finally delivering a sub-par service. 

## Consider The Total Package: What All Services They Offer?

Ensuring that Security guards show up for their shift is Security 101. But truly comprehensive security requires a whole suite of [services](/services) tailored to your needs and risks. During the evaluation phase, get a full rundown of their capabilities to ensure they check all your must-have boxes.

Some key services to inquire about:

- [Overall security management and strategy](/security/intro)
- [Access control systems](/services/security/ess/cctv)
- [Surveillance technology](/services/security/ess/video_analytics)
- [Mobile patrol services](/services/security/iss/patrol)
- [Emergency response](/services/security/iss/emergency) and [incident management](/security/governance/incident)
- [Thorough staff training and supervision](/security/measures/culture)

" alt="Services" width="400" height ="400" />

It's also advantageous to check if they have specialised expertise in areas specific to your industry, such as [Warehouse](https://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/warehouse),  logistics and transportation security, corporate campus protection, or [retail](/blog/retail-security-guards)

The bottom line: don't settle for a one-size-fits-all approach. You will need to engage services of a security partner who understands the nuances of your operations and can [create a tailor-made program](/security/planning/strategy) that covers you from every angle.

## Behind the Scenes: Company Values and Customer Retention

Here's something that might not be at the top of your criteria list, but needs to be: the agency's core values and customer turnover rates. This helps you understand the following:
- The security guards you see is  a direct reflection of the company behind the scenes
- Low Customer Turnover indicates service reliability

Always work with an agency that prides itself on integrity, professionalism, and respect. One that emphasises continual training and employee development to ensure their team is [operating at the highest standards](/security/intro). 

It is preferable to work with an agency that sees their role as not just guarding a property, but [cultivating a safe, welcoming environment](/security/governance/security).

A few ways to gauge an agency's values and reliability:

- Check out their website and mission statement
- Understand their Training Systems
- Get a feel for their communication style
- Average Tenure of Customer Contracts

You're not just hiring security guards - you're entrusting an essential service to a team that will represent your organization. Make sure they're truly aligned with your principles.

## Tech-Savvy  for the Modern Age

Let's face it, we live in a high-tech world. Criminals and threats have evolved, so your security will also need to evolve. When evaluating potential security partners, put some emphasis on their use of modern technology and systems.

Some key tech and innovative practices to look for:

- Robust visitor management and access control systems
- [State-of-the-art surveillance capabilities with analytics](/services/security/ess/video_analytics)
- Mobile patrol monitoring and emergency communications 
- Secure cloud-based reporting and analytics
- Cutting-edge screening and detection equipment

The most effective solutions combine latest technologies with highly-trained human intelligence and decision-making. The Security Guards you hire need to be trained to leverage the tools  and data to be proactive in identifying and mitigating threats.

Do understand how the agency integrates its technology to develop a [cohesive security strategy](/security/planning/strategy) that provides real, demonstrable benefits. In the end, all the fancy gadgets in the world won't mean a thing if they don't make your people and assets more secure.

##  Find Your Perfect Security Fit

There's no one-size-fits-all security solution. It's about finding the right agency with the right capabilities and mindset to tackle your unique risks and needs.

So do your due diligence - vet candidates thoroughly, ask the tough questions, and find an agency in lockstep with your organisation's values. Getting your security right by hiring security guards from a professional agency, lets everything else falls into place. Do bear in mind that safety of your people and  assets results in your bottom line stays safe and secure.
