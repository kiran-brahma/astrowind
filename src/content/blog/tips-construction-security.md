Effective **construction site security** planning is essential to prevent damage and theft. Sites are often targeted by thieves for valuable items such as copper wire, machinery and power tools. Poor security planning leads to quick and easy theft, causing an estimated $50 million in losses yearly.

## Effective Tips[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/tips-construction#effective-tips)

* One way to deter theft is to control the insider threat by making workers and subcontractors aware of the rules and consequences. This should be part of their induction. Smaller firms may find it harder to implement effective security measures due to a lack of infrastructure and budget.
    
* A construction site should be well-fenced and lit, with a "No Trespassing" sign board. Materials and tools should be secured in storage boxes and cargo trailers with strong locks and chains. Regular checks should be done to ensure the integrity of the fencing. [CCTV cameras](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv) can also help spot thieves and initiate action immediately.
    
* All key equipment should be recorded, including serial numbers. Electronic security measures are a key component of site security and are relatively inexpensive to implement.
    
* Security personnel should be given an induction and detailed procedures to understand their roles and how to escalate incidents.
