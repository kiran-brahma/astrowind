## General Mistakes[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/payroll_startup#general-mistakes)

### Job Description[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/payroll_startup#job-description)

You must be careful not to become fixated on finding the ideal job description. However, you must specify the job criteria in detail. Always conduct a background check on potential hires to determine their qualifications, work history, and, if available, any criminal histories. To confirm the information on the CV and learn more about the candidate's work ethics, don't be afraid to contact their references in the professional world.

### Wrong Hiring[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/payroll_startup#wrong-hiring)

Startup owners sometimes make the critical error of hiring generalists, superstar performers, or even people who are precisely like themselves. As a result, the team might not be able to produce competitive outcomes. Terming employees as independent contractors is a key error as well. Even while it might seem sensible at the time, it might lead to significant issues later on. Your business will gain in the long term from a clear distinction from the very beginning. Startups commit the deadly mistake of disregarding the payroll system, which results in improper payroll, poor record keeping, incorrect payments, and even missed tax payments.

Finding top personnel for startups is a challenging undertaking with the entrepreneurship surge in India. Therefore, founders turn to provide more perks, such as higher pay and stock. Set a hard cap and stick to it, even if it means firing a potential star employee, bearing in mind your long-term business objectives. Startups can strive to be overly picky and wind up burdening the staff with excessive paperwork and contracts. Documentation is vital, but you should keep it to a minimum so as not to jeopardize your interests.
