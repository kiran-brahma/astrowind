In today's world, businesses and organizations are increasingly relying on technology for their security needs. From security alarm systems to CCTV cameras, tech-based devices have become a common sight.

However, despite their effectiveness, these systems cannot match the value and impact of real-life [security guards](https://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/static-guarding). If you find yourself wondering whether tech-based security systems or mobile security patrols are better, we hope this blog post helps clear the doubts

## Mobility to Cover Multiple Locations

One of the key advantages of mobile security patrols is their ability to cover multiple locations. Unlike tech-based security systems such as alarms and [CCTV cameras](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv) which are fixed in one place, security guards on mobile patrols can move around the premises or area of duty. This mobility allows them to reach from point A to point B quickly and efficiently.

In situations where instant actions are required, such as in banks or areas under constant threat of crimes, mobile security patrols are essential. By combining the power of [remote monitoring](https://blog.knighthood.co/whyremotemonitoring) with the flexibility of mobile patrols, you can ensure better security for these high-risk areas.

## Human Intellect and Presence

While CCTV cameras and alarm systems are crucial components of a building's security system, they are ultimately just gadgets and machines. They cannot take action to stop a crime. When burglars break into a building, it is human presence that is required to take quick actions.

Security guards are well-trained to act fast in emergencies, and with the help of remote monitoring, they can be present in locations where any safety or security alert has been identified.

Technology can aid investigations and alert people, but it cannot prevent crimes from happening. For that, human intervention is necessary. By opting for mobile security patrols, you can ensure that there is always someone on-site to provide immediate assistance and maintain a safe environment.

## Better Utilization of Technology for Security

To make the most of technology in your security strategy, you need to deploy mobile patrolling guards. When the [video analytics](https://blog.knighthood.co/human-supervision-analytics) raises an alert due to a breach, the security guards can snap into action with the aid of a remote monitoring team. They can enter the premises, locate the intruders, and take the necessary steps to stop the crime.

In larger premises, an officer can be provided with access to a live camera feed via a mobile app. If any suspicious activity alert is raised, immediate action can be taken. By combining technology with the presence of mobile security guards, you can maximize the effectiveness of your security measures.

## Visible Security to Evade Crimes

Criminals often survey an area before attacking or breaching it. When they see uniformed security guards deployed at the gates, they may think twice about proceeding with their plans.

The mere presence of mobile security patrols can deter criminals and create a sense of fear among them. By being visibly present on duty, security guards can help keep criminals at bay and prevent crimes from occurring in the first place.

## Armed and Prepared Guards

While remote monitoring provides peace of mind by monitoring your premises, remote teams cannot take immediate action when a security breach occurs. In such situations, mobile security patrols are essential. When any events occur, patrol guards can be alerted instantly and can respond promptly to any security threats.

Even if there are people inside the building, a security guard is necessary to take immediate action in case of break-ins or attacks. Security Guards are [trained](/security/intro) and armed (if Armed Guards are part of the patrol team) to provide the necessary security against armed criminals. By having mobile security patrols in place, you can ensure a rapid and effective response to any security incidents.

## Cost-Effective

Installing a high-end tech-fuelled security system with alarms and security locks can be expensive. These systems provide only partial security and can cost a significant amount of money. If you have budget constraints, you can opt for remote monitoring and complement it with mobile security patrols and guards.

These well-trained guards, equipped with the necessary training, equipment, and security patrol software, can deliver top-notch security services at a reasonable cost. By choosing mobile security patrols, you can ensure high-end security within your budget.

## Avoid Future Threats

You can use Video Analytics to record data, send alerts, track people's and vehicle's movement and identify multiple small security and safety threats. By analysing this data, you can identify future threats and take proactive measures to mitigate them.

Mobile patrolling guards do not simply pass the time at the premises; they keep a keen eye on their surroundings, gather information about potential threats, analyse available data, and plan strategies to prevent crimes. With mobile security patrols on duty, you can sleep well at night knowing that your business and premises are safe.

## Performance and Data Evaluation

Mobile security patrols are typically part of a security company, supported by a team of supervisors and managers. With the help of video analytics software, these supervisors and managers can track data related to the guards, such as their arrival and departure times, patrol routes, incidents reported, and any other relevant information.

This data can be used for performance evaluation and analysis. By reviewing this data, you can identify any gaps or areas for improvement in your security measures and make necessary adjustments. This continuous evaluation allows you to optimize the performance of your security team and ensure that they are effectively protecting your premises.

## Emergency Response and Crisis Management

In times of emergencies or crises, having mobile security patrols can be invaluable. Security guards are trained to handle emergencies and can quickly respond to incidents such as fires, medical emergencies, or natural disasters. They can coordinate with emergency services, evacuate people, and provide assistance until professional help arrives.

With their training and experience, mobile security patrols can help mitigate the impact of emergencies and ensure the safety of everyone on the premises.

## Customer and Employee Confidence

Having mobile security patrols on your premises sends a strong message to your customers and employees that their safety is a top priority. The visible presence of security guards creates a sense of security and reassurance, which can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Employees also feel more secure and confident in their workplace when they know that trained security personnel are present to handle any security issues. By investing in mobile security patrols, you can build trust and confidence among your stakeholders.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while remote monitoring has its benefits, mobile security patrols offer unique advantages that cannot be replicated by gadgets and machines alone. The mobility, human presence and intellect, utilization of technology, visible security, armed readiness, cost-effectiveness, threat prevention, performance evaluation, emergency response capabilities, and impact on customer and employee confidence make mobile security patrols an essential component of a comprehensive security strategy.

By incorporating remote monitoring and mobile security patrols into your security measures, you can ensure the safety and protection of your premises, assets, and people.
