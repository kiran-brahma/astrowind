Warehouses, industrial plants, and storage facilities are often targets for theft and unauthorized access. Warehouse theft is a major concern across India, with both internal and external theft costing companies lakhs of rupees every year in damages, losses, and supply chain disruptions. As per the BSI and TT club cargo theft report, India accounts for around 65% of all cargo theft across Asia. To ensure the safety of your employees and inventory, it's essential to have a robust security plan in place.

## Access Control[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#access-control)

Access control is the first line of defence for any warehouse. While most warehouses already use some form of access control, many are still relying on outdated on-premise server systems and traditional credentials. Upgrading to more modern access control, like RFID warehouse door locks and cloud-based security platforms, can provide better security. A cloud-based, mobile access control system for warehouses is a smart investment that improves safety and strengthens security across the board. Some of the benefits of mobile and cloud-based warehouse security include:

* Smartphone-based credentials that eliminate key cards and fobs
    
* Remote access to the security management dashboard
    
* Customizable permissions for different levels of access
    
* Ability to adjust schedules for warehouse door locks at any time
    
* Cloud-based software that is automatically updated without expensive maintenance fees
    
* All-access activity is logged for easy auditing and improved compliance
    

## Security Cameras[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#security-cameras)

Having visibility into what’s happening inside and outside the facility is a must for warehouse security. Installing warehouse security cameras at key ingress and egress points will provide a visual of incoming and outgoing products, as well as add visual identity verification of who is accessing the space. Having eyes on what is going on inside the warehouse can also help improve employee safety.

## Remote Management[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#remote-management)

Especially for companies with multiple warehouse buildings or locations, a smart access control system with remote capabilities reduces administrative burden by centralizing security management on one easily accessible interface. Even with just one warehouse, remote management has an impressive ROI. Cloud-based systems with remote monitoring allow admins and managers to see what’s happening in real-time, without being on-site. This is great for after-hours security, or when staffing at the warehouse is limited due to social distancing or capacity constraints.

## Alerts and Notifications[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#alerts-and-notifications)

To take full advantage of remote management and integrated systems, warehouse teams should set up customized alerts and notifications. For example, setting an alert for an access event, such as a door left ajar, or a repeated attempt to use an unauthorized credential, the warehouse access control system can send a text or email to the right person to handle the response.

## Inventory Management[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#inventory-management)

Using RFID and barcode scanners for inventory tracking is a common upgrade for eliminating manual data logging and reducing the chance of human error in inventory tracking. By connecting your inventory management system to access control and warehouse video surveillance systems, you open the door for powerful automation across the entire operation.

## Emergency Plans[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#emergency-plans)

Dealing with any type of emergency is stressful. But by taking a proactive approach to security, and planning for different emergencies, warehouses can reduce the impact of a crisis. When creating warehouse emergency plans, it’s important to consider the unique features of each building and location.

## Regular Audits[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-security-planning#regular-audits)

Just because you’ve installed new warehouse security systems recently doesn’t mean you're getting the best protection. Situations can change very quickly, so scheduling regular security audits can prevent more serious problems before they occur. Even the most modern technology requires regular audits and updates! Using a workplace security audit checklist, you and your warehouse security system integrator can check that all your physical security systems are in working order.

By implementing these warehouse security best practices, you can protect your inventory, employees, and bottom line. Don't wait until it's too late to secure your warehouse, start improving your security today.
