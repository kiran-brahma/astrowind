Government organizations are legally obligated to protect their operations from disruption. The International Standards Organization (ISO) has established standards for business continuity.

Your CEO is responsible for ensuring your organization has appropriate business continuity management arrangements in place.

## Requirements for business continuity

Every organization must have preparations in place to handle disruptions to their business. They must:

- Take action to ensure they can operate to the fullest extent (even if at a reduced level) during and after an emergency
- Carry out business continuity planning activities to:
    - Fulfill your response and recovery roles
    - Minimize risks of business disruption
    - Put plans and strategies in place for maintaining critical business processes.

## ISO Standards
