What if members of the service team you just engaged have a history of stealing  Or perhaps a worker at your factory has been accused of sexual harassment in the past? Perhaps one of your warehouse's guards has prior convictions. Companies now need to actively focus on pre-employment screening to avoid future risks in their business

The statistics clearly illustrate why companies need to look into a prospective individual's previous history in greater depth. Over 10% of skilled workers offer falsified documents. 3% of blue-collar workers may have a civil or criminal record. There are several examples of persons being fired for doing things that are not in the company's long-term interests or for simply being unable to obey directives and regulations.

Background checks are valued by businesses, but for Human resources, it can be a mammoth task. It might be costly to engage an outside organization to do background investigations. It takes time to gather data for decision-making and even to establish company policies because multiple processes operate at different locations. It could be unproductive to contact a person's previous employers to ask about work behaviors and ethics.

So, how do you go about performing background checks on your blue-collar employees? How can you quickly, accurately, and efficiently ensure that only reliable candidates are employed?

### Digital Process[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/employee-verification#digital-process)

Managing and hiring a sizable, dispersed staff frequently results in human errors. It is challenging to monitor with ease, as migrant workers make up a significant portion of the blue-collar workforce. This results in poor staffing decisions.

These employees' profiles need to be vetted quickly and have access to a range of information. Against each profile, supervisors and hiring managers need precise reports so that questionable profiles can be proactively eliminated.

We have a complete digital solution where our field staff updates all information regularly and post validation of various information against the employee. We adhere to stringent SLA to ensure that our customers get access to all information as quickly as possible. Our system eliminates the need for a paper-based system to keep track of all information as all necessary information is available in the cloud, allowing for quick access anytime

## Why Verification is crucial[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/employee-verification#why-verification-is-crucial)

Numerous small startups, such as food delivery, home services, and ride-sharing services, are part of the on-demand economy, generating a lot of job opportunities for blue-collar workers. These employees' inappropriate conduct not only harms their reputation and business opportunities but also develops negative connotations with their brand. Such companies lack the resources necessary to carry conduct thorough background checks, particularly during peak seasons.

Knighthood's complete blue-collar staff verification and management system can aid you to avoid such failures. We make the vetting process incredibly quick, simple, and affordable for all companies across India.
