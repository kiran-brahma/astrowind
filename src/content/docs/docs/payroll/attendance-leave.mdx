As per the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, the employers have to provide 26 weeks paid leave to any women who have worked for at least 80 days in the 12 months. Out of the 26 weeks, up to eight weeks can be claimed before delivery. Organizations with 10 + employees are eligible for the establishment of this act including their women employees on a contract or permanent basis.

### National Holidays
National Holidays are the fixed holidays in India on January 26, August 15, and October 2 every year. These days are Holidays and if an employee works on these days, he/she is either offered a compensatory off or paid double wage for the day

### Religious holidays
Religious Holidays given for Employees to be with their families on Key festivals. You need to provide a minimum of 9 Holidays in a year including National holidays, so 6 days are needed to be provided under this head

## Loss of Pay (LOP)

When an employee avails leaves even when they have none left in their account, then salary will not be paid for these excess leaves. These leaves are termed as Loss of Pay(LOP) or Leave Without Pay(LWOP).


### LOP Calculation

The calculation of Loss of Pay is based on the calendar day logic. You may also state that if an employee avails leave without approval, they will termed as LOP.

When deducting salary for Loss of Pay(LOP), the number of working days in a month impact the final deduction:

* Loss of pay when days = 30

    -  Loss of Pay = INR 30,000/30 = INR 1,000 per day

* Loss of Pay when days are calculated excluding Weekends

    - 8 Saturdays and Sundays in a month
    - Effective days = 30-8=22 days
    - Loss of Pay = INR 30,000/22 = INR 1,364/ per day

You need to define the LOP policy and ensure employees are informed prior
