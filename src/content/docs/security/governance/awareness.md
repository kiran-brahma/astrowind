Increase security awareness throughout your organisation to make everyone aware of potential security risks and ensure adherence to security processes. Security awareness training is a must to cultivate a strong security culture that safeguards people, information, and assets.

## Determine Training Requirements

Knighthood uses a consistent and structured method to determine your organisation's training requirements.

### Security Awareness Training

The security awareness training is designed to:

- Address risks identified during risk review
- Ensure compliance with security policies and processes
- Encourage employees and contractors to take personal responsibility for effective security, regardless of role or access level.

### Scope

Trainees are made aware of security measures in:

- Your facilities
- Facilities handling your information and assets
- Places where your employees or contractors are working.

### Security Measures

The training will include policies and processes for:

- Personal safety
- Asset protection
- Official information protection
- Reporting (security incidents, changes in personal circumstances, and any mandatory or legislative reporting requirements)
- Attending security briefings (when required).

## People to Involve

Knighthood provides security awareness training and briefings to all employees and contractors based in your facilities

## Training Goals

Everyone in your organization needs to understand security rules, as well as any responsibilities related to their roles or work areas.

Knighthood provides the knowledge your people need to effectively carry out security duties. They must comprehend the threats that your security measures are designed to combat in order to sustain security.

## Training Process

The training programmes use a mixture of delivery methods based on customer requirements

## Training Process Implementation

Security awareness training is an ongoing, regular part of your organization's operations.

### Onboarding

Knighthood recommends including security awareness training in your organization's onboarding process from the start.

### Refreshers

Knighthood organizes regular refresher trainings to remind employees about security measures and alert them to any new ones.

### Training of Emergency, Safety, or Security Roles

Knighthood strives to keep your people and visitors as safe as possible. We design extra training for people with emergency, safety, or security roles so they can help keep everyone safe during times of danger or threat. We also run exercises to help them practice their skills and confirm their ongoing competence.

## Clear Communication

To bolster your security awareness training and culture, Knighthood suggests staying engaged about your security measures. Here are some possibilities:

- Utilize security campaigns to address ongoing security needs or special requirements related to sensitive areas, activities, or timeframes.
- Broadcast security processes and hints through publications, electronic bulletins, and visual displays (e.g. posters).
- Conduct security drills and exercises.
- Include security questions in job interviews.
- Include security attitudes and performance in your performance management program.

## Employee Safety Handbook

Knighthood recommends creating an Employee Safety Handbook and making it readily available to all in your organization. The Handbook should include:

- Emergency response guidelines and contact information
- Safety requirements and procedures
- Safety measures for areas of heightened risk, such as public areas.

## Give advice about how to protect assets

Knighthood recommends that everyone is knowledgeable about how to safeguard their organization's assets. Before granting access, we recommend providing training on:

- Utilizing access control systems and other methods to secure assets
- Complying with legal requirements for protecting assets
- Reporting lost, damaged, or stolen assets
- Following audit and inventory protocols for assets.

## Report security concerns

Knighthood recommends that organizations create an internal process for reporting security concerns and train everyone to report any risks they encounter. For example, they should be encouraged to report:

- Suspicious behavior
- Threatening behavior communicated through letters, bomb threats, and phone calls
- Lost, stolen, or broken security equipment
- Security infringements and breaches
- Full secure waste bins
- Lost identity or credit cards
- Lost protectively-marked or official material
- Serious wrongdoing (within the organization or another).
