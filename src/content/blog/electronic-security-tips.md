Here are nine important reasons to install electronic security on your premises:

## 1) Assets Protection[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#assets-protection)

Electronic security is a cost-effective way to protect your assets, such as money, furniture, and confidential information. According to the Kroll Annual Global Theft Report, 60% of fraud is committed by personnel - making it essential to have evidence against it. CCTV Security Cameras provide this.

## 2) Safe Workplace[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#safe-workplace)

Having an alarm system in place gives your employees peace of mind and control in case of any emergencies.

## 3) Instant Security Updates[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#instant-security-updates)

Modern electronic security systems can be monitored from computers, tablets, or phones. This allows you to stay informed of any security breaches, even when travelling.

## 4) Protection when Premises Unattended[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#protection-when-premises-unattended)

New technology allows you to control security from anywhere in the world. Complex security codes and remote access to CCTV Security Cameras keep your business and assets safe.

## 5) Conflict Resolution[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#conflict-resolution)

Integrated security systems may help to resolve any disputes by providing evidence.

## 6) Value for Money[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#value-for-money)

Better safe than sorry - electronic security systems provide value and peace of mind.

## 7) Internal Theft Control[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#internal-theft-control)

CCTV Security Cameras can help to control internal theft. Place them near cash counters or where employees often work.

## 8) Monitoring High-Risk Areas[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#monitoring-high-risk-areas)

CCTV Cameras can be placed in areas that are vulnerable to vandalism, theft, or break-ins. This helps to monitor your business and deter criminals.

## 9) Automation and Analytics[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/electronic-security#automation-and-analytics)

New CCTV technology performs advanced threat detection through facial recognition and spotting potential criminals. Automation and analytics provide efficient use of resources to control any emergencies.
