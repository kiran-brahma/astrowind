## Introduction

In today's world, we have access to multiple electronic security solutions, such as [CCTV cameras, alarm systems, and access control](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess). These solutions are effective in deterring crime and protecting property but are not foolproof.  Criminals can identify multiple means to bypass such systems.

To ensure high-quality security of your premises, you will need to deploy security guards. Security guards provide a human element to security that electronic solutions cannot. Security guards with the aid of electronic security solutions and [remote monitoring](https://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/remote) can respond to security alerts as and when they arise. Their presence also deters criminals from taking action

In addition, security guards also assist in the following additional services:

- Customer service: Security guards greet visitors and provide them with directions, keeping your premises in order and preventing incidents.
- Loss prevention: The security guard's presence prevents theft and vandalism as they keep an eye out for suspicious activity.
- Fire safety: Security guards can help to prevent fires and evacuate people in the event of an emergency.
- Medical assistance: Security guards can provide first aid in emergencies.

While [security guards](https://knighthood.co/blog/security-guard-types) play an important role in keeping places safe, choosing the right security company is essential for ensuring your guards are effective. The company you partner with can make or break your security program.

Many security companies exist but you should consider more than just pricing when selecting one.
