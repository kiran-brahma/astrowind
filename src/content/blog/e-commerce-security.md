The most crucial elements to ensuring effective workflow in a warehouse facility are security and warehouse sop management, which cannot be ignored. The warehouse is a constant hub of activity, exposing them to a variety of hazards and risks due to the constant entry and exit of employees, expensive items, and vehicles. If not prevented promptly, a number of unknown risks to a storage facility could result in significant losses.

The installed base of IoT devices is anticipated to reach over 31 billion globally by 2020 and 75 billion by 2025, according to Statista. The growth of IoT in the enterprise sector is being driven by the demand for solutions to manage business operations efficiently and effectively. Intelligent warehouse systems can stop a threat in its tracks and safeguard assets from harm. IoT can transform a storage facility into a smart, connected warehouse, offering useful business insights that can boost productivity and operational effectiveness.

## E-commerce Security Operating Process[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#e-commerce-security-operating-process)

Without the capacity to monitor daily operations in order to increase productivity, e-commerce warehouses find it difficult to match the high needs and expectations of consumers. To guarantee prompt deliveries and compliance with safety-related regulations, warehouses adhere to a tight set of SOPs.

### Inventory management[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#inventory-management)

The manual technique of inventory management has several drawbacks and difficulties that lead to operational inefficiency, human mistake, and data loss.

Installed between the inventory storage, IoT-supported e-surveillance cameras offer complete visibility and precise updates on inventory pickup. E-commerce warehouses frequently struggle with issues including lost shipments and a lack of video documentation of package movements, both incoming and outbound. Cloud-based security cameras create a GRN database to store shipping data after scanning them, offering a practical way to manage inventory and keep track of delivered products. With precise information on package movements and secure footage that can be quickly accessed for analysis if a shipment is lost, it improves workflow efficiency.

### Roster management[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#roster-management)

Compliance with SOPs improves productivity and assists in completing daily chores as listed on the schedule. IoT-enabled solutions that give real-time updates on SOP deviation enable warehousers to quickly pinpoint the root cause of package delivery delays as well as other areas for improvement. According to the insights, roster management can be improved to increase operational effectiveness.

### Delivery management[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#delivery-management)

In e-commerce warehouses, late deliveries are a typical problem, and it can be challenging to pinpoint the root of the problem. Efficiency can be increased by having visibility into SOP adherence with IoT solutions and knowing if the items are being delivered by the requirements. Administration heads are kept aware via real-time updates on SOP deviation. Another crucial SOP to prevent any loss or damage is strict adherence to the handling of items.

## Typical Security Challenges[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#typical-security-challenges)

### Fire[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#fire)

Warehouse premises have storage spaces that are generally tightly packed with goods. Even a small fire within the facility can lead to a devastating accident. From fluctuating electricity to the negligence of ground-level employees, there can be several factors behind a fire mishap. Proactive smoke sensors that can detect harmful smoke particles, generate an instant alert to notify security heads at an initial stage and prevent fire and damage to valuable goods stored inside the warehouse.

### Intrusion[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/e-commerce-security#intrusion)

The majority of warehouses are situated outside of cities. Frequent incursions can be seen as a regular difficulty by warehouses for their distributed sites since they occur in a large facility with several entry and exit points, which results in theft and robbery of valuable commodities and items.

At the perimeter, entryways, and exit points, IoT-enabled e-surveillance cameras with AI-based video analytics can be installed. Any intruder who tries to enter without authorization is immediately caught on camera, alerted by a hooter and floodlights, and real-time notifications on a remote platform alert security heads and local authorities so the intrusion can be stopped in time. E-surveillance monitoring also keeps a close eye on every area inside the building to make sure that any suspicious activity is quickly discovered.

The visibility of typical security threats and management, which frequently result in unintended loss to the warehouse, is increased by a connected and intelligent e-commerce warehouse. IoT solutions give corporate leaders access to real-time updates on warehouse SOP and security deviations, allowing them to stop threats in their tracks and identify improvement areas to stop productivity loss. It improves business optimization and boosts operational effectiveness to control traffic and e-commerce business swings.
