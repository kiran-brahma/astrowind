If you're thinking about hiring a [security service](http://knighthood.co/services/security), you're probably wondering why you should. After all, it's an investment, and you want to make sure you're getting your money's worth. Here are the top 10 reasons why you should hire a security service:

## 1\. Prevent crimes[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#1-prevent-crimes)

[Security officers](http://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/static-guarding) offer a physical visual deterrent from crime. The presence of even one officer will dramatically reduce the rates of crime and prevent the likelihood of an assailant inflicting harm. If security personnel catch someone causing trouble on your property, they can intercept and stop them immediately.

## 2\. Add a sense of heightened awareness[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#2-add-a-sense-of-heightened-awareness)

Security officers offer an extra pair of eyes and ears at all times. Their presence is purposeful and distinct in providing immediate action in a multitude of possible scenarios, from de-escalating a situation to deterring hostility. Security cultivates situational awareness and maintains balance.

## 3\. Improve customer service[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#3-improve-customer-service)

In many ways, a security officer job and customer service go hand in hand. When it comes to protecting property or a person, it is always about the customer. It is their job to keep customers safe, and in doing so you often find yourself chatting with customers to ask how they are and how you can help them. The better you listen to customers, the more successful you are at serving those around you. As a result, security often builds a report with clients, greeting customers and serving as their first impression of the business.

## 4\. Provide a quick response time[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#4-provide-a-quick-response-time)

In [incident response](http://knighthood.co/security/planning/incident), security must react immediately, as every second counts. Discovering and remediating the threat as quickly as possible is paramount. Security is crucial in gaining control of a situation while awaiting the arrival of the police or emergency medical services.

## 5\. Handle security issues in an efficient manner[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#5-handle-security-issues-in-an-efficient-manner)

Security uses clear judgment to protect the asset and assess the situation for the best means of action. The difference between an incident being detected and remediated in two minutes versus two hours could be the difference between life and death. The threat environment can change quickly, so it is crucial to handle security issues efficiently. Containing the situation is critical to avoiding panic and escalation of the threat. Having organization, proper procedures, and adequate staffing makes it easier to address and resolve the issue effectively, and return the business to its standard operations quickly.

## 6\. Create a safe business environment[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#6-create-a-safe-business-environment)

Having security present helps create a safe business environment, which is beneficial in any industry - be it retail, office, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, or events. The presence of security provides a sense of safety and assurance to both employees and customers.

## 7\. Have someone on site who can handle security matters[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#7-have-someone-on-site-who-can-handle-security-matters)

An [emergency](http://knighthood.co/services/Security/iss/emergency) is often met with a team of responders that may include security personnel, law enforcement, fire department and medical personnel. An untrained person who is unfamiliar with protocols may find this combination intimidating and overwhelming. Security is not only familiar with communicating well with each department but they are also trained to handle the complexities of clear reporting and emergency response.

## 8\. Promote a sense of order[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#8-promote-a-sense-of-order)

Security is crucial in enforcing rules and regulations, maintaining discipline, and controlling violations in the workplace. Security personnel have the authority to take disciplinary action against individuals who misbehave or violate the rules. They also play a vital role in [large crowds, preventing mob fights, riots, and drunk and disorderly conduct](http://knighthood.co/blog/why-event-security) while maintaining order.

## 9\. Have someone onsite who is trained in CPR and AED[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#9-have-someone-onsite-who-is-trained-in-cpr-and-aed)

Security officers are first responders. In an emergency, there is not always time to wait for the police or EMTs. Having an officer present who is trained to use an AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) or perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is crucial. This can make a significant difference between life and death.

## 10\. Reduce your stress levels[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security#10-reduce-your-stress-levels)

Professional security officers handle unpleasant situations you would feel less comfortable dealing with. Knowing that you or your business is protected provides peace of mind so you can rest easier.
