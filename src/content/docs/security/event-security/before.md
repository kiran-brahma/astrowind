Knighthood works with event organizers to develop protective security and safety requirements during the planning stages. We help with:

- Appointing qualified personnel to security roles
- Assessing threats
- Creating a security plan
- Inspecting potential venues
- Assisting with event preparation.

## Event Manager and Event Security Officer

We recommend customers identify an Event Manager and Event Security Officer (ESO) at the outset. The Event Manager is responsible for overall security; the ESO is responsible for implementing security for the event and venue and must have knowledge of protective security. The ESO should:

- Be senior enough to exercise the necessary authority
- Have direct access to the Event Manager
- Have a sound understanding of protective security.

For large or long-running events, the ESO will have a support team.

### Event Security Officer

The ESO's duties include:

- Seeking advice on potential threats to the event from customer organization personnel
- Conducting a security risk assessment for the event/venue(s)
- Creating security plans based on the risk assessment
- Making necessary security preparations for the event
- Coordinating security during the event
- Liaising with customer organization personnel, external agencies, and authorities before, during, and after the event.

## Threat Assessment

We focus our efforts on considering possible threats to the event and simultaneously undertake preliminary work on the event plan. The ESO requests advice on possible threats from:

- The organization coordinating the event and any other relevant departments
- External agencies

We identify, assess, and manage the risks to an event in accordance with the principles outlined in [ISO 31000:2018 Risk management - Guidelines](https://www.iso.org/standard/65694.html).

## Event Security Plan

We will develop a security plan based on a risk assessment of the event. The plan will evolve as details of the event become clearer and preparations progress. It will depend on the duration, location, and size of the event.

### Protection

During the development of our security plan, we answer the following questions to understand what needs to be protected:

- What needs to be protected: proceedings, documents (provided and notes taken during the event), and people attending?
- What kind of threats exist?
- What is the appropriate security level for the event?
- How long will it last?
- Will the protection needs remain constant or vary?
- When might increased security measures be necessary?
- Will attendees visit other sites or activities as part of the event?

### Location Analysis

Customers have various sites to choose from—some within their facilities, others at external venues. We focus our efforts to answer the following questions:

- How much control do we need over the event?
- How sensitive is the information that will be present?
- What unique risks does each site pose?
- How does the event's flow affect our choice?
- What transport options are available?
- How can we protect the attendees?

We find out what security is already available and what needs to be put in place. We also note any potential risks we haven’t identified. Our ESO accompanies the event organiser during the preliminary inspection, or provides security advice if they can’t attend.

If protest activity is possible, we involve the local police early in the event planning. A more detailed inspection might be required later, once a venue is chosen. We maintain contact with local police and venue management team to gain local knowledge throughout.

When inspecting a venue, we focus on answering the following questions:

- What could negatively impact physical security?
    - How easy or difficult is it to address any issues? Examples include door locks and window catches, curtain fittings, exterior lights, and light fixtures.
- Is it possible to control access to the venue?
    - This includes the venue, individual rooms, and any on-site parking.
- Is there a space to inspect suspicious items?

## Questionnaire

Knighthood will analyze and respond to the following questions to better assist our customers:

- How will communication be managed between different parts of the organization and other organizations involved in the event?
- What are the duties of event personnel?
- Who is responsible for interacting with the Police, if necessary (e.g. in the case of potential protest action)?
- Who will attend the event?
- Who are the attendees?
    - What organizations do they work for or represent?
- Will any overseas people attend?
- Any media representatives or members of the public?
- Are there security clearance or character check requirements for attendees?
- Will any VIPs attend, and if so, do they require personal protection?
    - Is there a need to arrange accommodation for VIPs or other attendees?
        - What are the accommodation security requirements?

## Contingency Plans

Our Contingency plans might include communications, command and control 
arrangements, and alternative venues for incidents (for example, bomb 
alerts and public demonstrations or protests).

## Event Protection

We detail the threats identified and the measures we plan to use to manage the risks. We consider any special protective security measures our customer might need, such as audio countermeasures, security containers, and other security equipment.

If the event involves protectively-marked information, our ESO should seek advice from the necessary external agencies based on our risk assessment. We then state in the event plan which measures will be put in place. For example, we recommend our customer:

- Strictly limit the number of invitees to the overall event
- Strictly limit the number of invitees to particular sessions
- Limit the duration of the event to as short a period as practicable
- Keep handouts to a minimum
- Secure the meeting room from audio-visual recording devices.

## Event Preparation

Based on our approved security plan and inspection of the venue, we focus our efforts to address key matters before the event, such as processes, arrangements, security controls, and logistical matters.

We need processes for:

- Controlling keys
- Managing entry
- Evacuating in emergencies
- Reporting security incidents
- Receiving and escorting visitors
- Storing, handling, and disposing of official or protectively-marked information.

We also need to arrange and prepare:

- Event set up schedules
- A communication plan
- Security instructions
- Security containers and equipment
- Access and identity passes
- Security clearances
- Security exercises
- Technical surveillance countermeasures
- Employees or guards to control access
- Searches to sanitise the premises.
