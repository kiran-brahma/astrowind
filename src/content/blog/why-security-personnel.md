## What do Security Personnel Protect?[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/why-security-personnel#what-do-security-personnel-protect)

[Security guards](http://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/static-guarding) are a key component in protecting an organization's people, information, and assets. Here are some ways that they do so:

* They reduce the risk of harm to employees, customers, and partners
    
* They reduce the risk of loss, damage, or compromise of information or assets
    
* They establish greater trust in those who access official or important information and assets
    
* They help organizations deliver services and operate more effectively
    

Personnel security is focused on reducing the [risks](http://knighthood.co/security/planning/risk) associated with insider threats. Insider threats come from past or present employees, contractors, or business partners who may misuse their inside knowledge or access to harm an organization's people, customers, assets, or reputation.

An insider threat is someone who exploits their authorized access to an organization's assets to harm its security, either intentionally or unintentionally. This can occur through espionage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, or the loss or degradation of a resource or capability. Common insider acts include unauthorized disclosure of official, private, or proprietary information, fraud or process corruption, unauthorized access to ICT systems, economic or industrial espionage, theft, and violence or physical harm to others.

Many [security breaches](http://knighthood.co/security/FAQ#what-is-a-security-breach) are unintentional and result from a lack of awareness or attention to security practices, being distracted, or being tricked into unwittingly helping a third party. Implementing effective personnel security measures can help organizations operate more efficiently with greater confidence in their ability to protect their people, assets, and information. Hiring experienced and professional security personnel is crucial in protecting an organization against the evolving threats of today's world.
