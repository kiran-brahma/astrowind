VIP protection agents commonly called as Bouncers within India, are highly skilled and highly experienced individuals trained for the protection of high-profile individuals and their families.

While movies depict Bouncers as tough individuals, who drive fancy cars while seeking to protect their high-profile clients, this is far from the truth generally.

VIP protection is a highly specialised field within the private security industry offering security, safety, and protection to high-profile individuals.
