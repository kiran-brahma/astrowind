Event security services are essential for ensuring the safety of event staff and attendees. Knowing that their safety and security are considered helps participants enjoy their experience, and having security officers present deters crime and misbehaviour. Their job is to respond to criminal activity and other emergencies. Here are tips for hiring the right security team and creating a safe, enjoyable event.

## What Is Event Security?[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#what-is-event-security)

Event security is a way to protect people from crime and emergencies. Start by assessing potential risks and threats to determine the kind of protection you need. For example:

* Is it an outdoor event with bad weather?
    
* Is there a chance of a medical emergency?
    
* Will there be high-profile guests needing protection?
    
* Will alcohol be served?
    
* Is theft or vandalism a concern?
    
* Is it a controversial event with protestors or attackers?
    
* Is there a terrorist threat?
    
* What access control is required?
    
* Are certain items prohibited? Do bags need to be checked?
    
* What activities will be involved?
    

Once risks are identified, hire a trained security services team. They should be experienced in crime prevention, guest monitoring, crowd control, etc.

## Tips for Hiring Event Security Services[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#tips-for-hiring-event-security-services)

Follow these eight tips to ensure you’re working with an experienced security services provider that meets your needs and expectations:

### Research Event Security Providers[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#research-event-security-providers)

Ask people who have hosted similar events about the company they hired for event security services. Did the event go smoothly? Were security breaches handled effectively? Was the protection adequate?

### Hire Qualified Security Officers[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#hire-qualified-security-officers)

You need to know your security guards are well-trained and equipped to handle any challenging or dangerous situations. Professional security guards should be licensed and have years of experience and successful history. Choose guards with a military or law enforcement background, as they not only understand the law but are also trained in recognizing potential hazards. They can handle difficult scenarios with composure.

### Work with a Full-Service Security Team[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#work-with-a-full-service-security-team)

Large-scale events require more than just a few security guards. To avoid working with multiple event security services, choose a company that provides:

* Personal bodyguards
    
* Armed and unarmed security guard services
    
* Video surveillance
    
* Other security solutions
    

A professional, qualified team of security experts will combine their expertise and experience with cutting-edge technology to keep your event secure from start to finish.

### Choose a Security Team Experienced with Your Event Type[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#choose-a-security-team-experienced-with-your-event-type)

Look for a security guard company that has experience with your event type to ensure they can handle the unique challenges associated with it. Don't hire a company that only staffs concerts or works in high schools for your convention.

### Assess the Event’s Security Needs[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#assess-the-events-security-needs)

Every event has different security needs. Consider crowd control, access control, conflict resolution, and more. Then, make sure you have enough security officers for the number of people in attendance.

### Evaluate the Venue[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#evaluate-the-venue)

The venue may have specific [security requirements](http://knighthood.co/security/event-security/before). In either case, your security team should evaluate the area to determine:

* Where each security guard should be posted
    
* Vulnerable access points
    
* Special circumstances that require planning
    

Understanding the layout of the space is crucial for the team to be effective. A reliable security partner should view the site personally.

### Specify Your Expectations[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#specify-your-expectations)

Do you need armed or unarmed security guards? What are your top security concerns? There are many valid reasons to hire event security services, and the team should be aware of what is most important to you and what is expected of them.

### Demand Quality Service[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/event-security#demand-quality-service)

A credible security services company should provide an open line of communication. You are their client, and they are working for you. They should answer your questions, address your worries, and keep you informed about security throughout the event.

Safety and security cannot be neglected at your event, regardless of its size. Having the correct security team in place will protect your guests and give you peace of mind.
