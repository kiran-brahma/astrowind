Knighthood Event Security officers carry out tasks to ensure the event is wrapped up securely.

## Post Events

### Post-event Responsibilities

After the event, Knighthood completes the following tasks, if necessary:

### Retrieving or Disabling Access and Identity Passes

If event access and identity passes provide unescorted access to the organisation's venue, Knighthood coordinates retrieving all passes. If not possible, they recommend disabling any access provided by the passes.

### Searching the Venue

A thorough search of the venue is undertaken to ensure no official information or assets belonging to the organisation have been left behind. This includes items such as documents, audio-visual recordings, whiteboards, projection equipment and electronic media equipment.

### Returning Security Containers (if Used)

Any security containers used at the event are returned, including changing combination settings for container travel and storage.

## Security Report

Knighthood submits a final security report to the event organiser.

## Reporting any Unreported Security Incident

For any security incidents that occurred during the event that have not been reported, we report them in accordance with the process outlined in the [Incident Reporting and Security Investigations](/security/governance/incident).

## Returning Protectively-Marked Material

Knighthood arranges the secure transmission of any protectively-marked event papers and documentation to all attendees
