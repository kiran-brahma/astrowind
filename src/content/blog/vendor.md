Sometimes all it takes to find a supplier or service provider is to ask a friend who they use in their industry. Other times, a formal selection procedure is required. We all choose service providers regularly, often without even recognizing it or giving it much thought. As homeowners, we choose businesses for pest treatment, phone service, home security, homeowner's insurance, auto insurance, and possibly a thousand other options. Most of those businesses as well. In current times, as businesses across try to reduce costs without impact on service, choosing a partner needs to be well thought out to avoid future issues

## Selection process[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#selection-process)

In most businesses, the process can be either of the following options

1. Select a provider from the internet or a friend or a family member's suggestion
    
2. Continue with the same service provider if one is already in place
    
3. Seek advice from a trusted resource or friend, who underwent the same situation at hand
    
4. Adopt a structured selection process
    

***Option 1*** is not recommended unless it's a one-off issue or a very low value service as luck plays a large role here. *Option 2 and 3* are much recommended as service is not easy to be quantified without prior experience, hence recommendation from someone avoids the risk of choosing a poor provider.

Meanwhile, ***Option 4*** is a wise decision to make when you're purchasing something for your business, such as a service, a contract, or a sizable item. Asking the service providers, why you need to give them your money helps you understand in detail on various attributes of their service delivery. Making the most appropriate decision requires a thorough examination of your options and an evaluation of your financial situation.

## Identification Process[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#identification-process)

### Document your requirements[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#document-your-requirements)

Before making any sort of selection of the new suppliers, you must first thoroughly or at least broadly outline what you require. This will come in handy when you examine your notes and the vendor's offering to discover that not all offerings aren't identical. When you meet with prospective vendors, you must be able to weigh their capabilities against what your business needs from them and determine whether there is a good fit. If possible, list down all needs while giving each requirement a weightage to help you in the later process.

### Identify Potential Partners[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#identify-potential-partners)

Your best course of action is to do your research and determine which businesses appear to be doing the greatest job of providing the service or commodity you require.

Once you've done that, call or email each vendor and let them know your requirements and that you'd appreciate their input in the selection process. Recognize that if this is a very low-cost item, they won't be too interested in investing a lot of time, money, and resources to win your business.

It would be recommended to provide the following information:

1. Your Introduction and contact information
    
2. Brief Summary of your needs
    
3. Invitation to participate in your selection process
    
4. Proposed Timelines for Discussions on Proposal
    

### Initial discussions[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#initial-discussions)

Once the vendors have shown interest in your business. Conduct an individual discussion with each vendor to understand their offerings in detail while evaluating them as per the needs identified earlier. Ideally, limit to a max of 5-6 vendors initially and choose to connect with more only if the initial lot doesn't meet your needs in a holistic StandardResources

### Vendor Elimination[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#vendor-elimination)

Score each vendor on all attributes that matter to you and as per the list developed. If possible, get another 2-3 people to participate in this process, scoring each vendor individually. Tabulate the final score, while also maintaining a minimum score for each attribute so that minimum standards are maintained at every level. Once the list has been trimmed to 2-3 vendors, send across a request for a price proposal if not done or confirm if earlier pricing is still valid after the discussion round is held so frame

### Final Evaluation[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#final-evaluation)

Each finalist has one more chance to convince you to accept their offer. Bring them back separately once more to discuss on the price basis your needs discussion prior. You might want to be even more clear at this point about any unique requirements your firm may have. Give them all the information you can so they can either sell themselves or trip themselves up. You're trying to figure out how to choose the greatest vendor possible in terms of both pricing and service. In this step, you're searching for the differentiators.

### Final Decision[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#final-decision)

It's time to examine your notes from the two meetings you had with each vendor before making a final choice. How to arrive at a final decision is your prerogative. Preferably, it needs to be based on both cost and vendor competence so that they match your needs and cost. The trick is to establish and stick to the goals identified earlier.

Frequently switching providers again may result in more fees along with service disruption. It's unlikely that you'll decide poorly after all this work. However, in case after a certain period, you believe that Vendor B will be better than the current choice, then go ahead to change vendor but choose after deliberation. Most service contracts are valid for a year, so if it's not a big challenge, you can change vendors after end of an existing contract

## Conclusion[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/vendor#conclusion)

Choosing the right vendor for your services is a key exercise that allows your business to thrive. It is important to choose vendors who can be your partners in your growth, allowing you to focus your energies on focus approaches.
