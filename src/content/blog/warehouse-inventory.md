As a business owner, safeguarding your assets is crucial. You can have the most advanced technology and efficient warehousing solutions, but without secure inventory, your efforts may be for nothing.

## Essential Security Measures to Protect Your Inventory[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-inventory#essential-security-measures-to-protect-your-inventory)

Not all warehouse security systems are created equal. It's important to understand the specific [security measures](https://knighthood.co/security/requirements/governance) in place before entrusting a storage facility with your valuable inventory. Here are some important security features to look for:

### Round-The-Clock Video Monitoring[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-inventory#round-the-clock-video-monitoring)

Large quantities of products and goods are stored in warehouses, which often require vast, sprawling facilities. That's why the use of cameras and video monitoring is an essential component of any effective warehouse security system. Key features to consider when evaluating your video monitoring system include:

* 24/7 monitoring and recording
    
* Retention of recordings
    
* Remote (cell-connected) access
    
* Camera resolution
    
* Alarm system integration
    

### On-Site Personnel[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-inventory#on-site-personnel)

A Reliable and well-coordinated security patrol is essential for warehouse security. At Knighthood, we recommend that warehouses be patrolled by professional security personnel during closed hours to ensure the highest level of inventory protection. Additionally, all of our employees are well-trained in various aspects of warehouse security according to our standard operating procedures.

### Physical Security[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/security/warehouse-inventory#physical-security)

While technology has revolutionized warehouse security practices, physical elements such as fencing, walls, secure access points, and strategic lighting remain important aspects of warehouse security. These measures should not be overlooked.

By implementing these essential security measures, you can rest assured that your inventory is safe and protected at all times. You can refer to our [Warehouse Security FAQ Post](https://knighthood.co/blog/warehouse-faq) to understand more about how to ensure optimum security for your warehouses
