In this blog post, we will discuss how video analytics can help warehouses in their security, safety, and employee productivity.

## Security[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/warehouses#security)

Video analytics can be used to ensure that all parameters of the warehouse are 24X7 protected. By installing [cameras](http://knighthood.co/services/security/ess/cctv) at strategic locations, it is possible to monitor all the activities in the warehouse. Video analytics software can identify any suspicious activity and alert the local team. This ensures that the team can take quick action and prevent any potential threat to the warehouse.

Moreover, video analytics can help reduce [patrolling](http://knighthood.co/services/security/iss/patrol) expenses. Instead of having security personnel patrolling the warehouse, video analytics can do the job. This not only saves money but also ensures that the warehouse is under constant surveillance.

## Safety[​](http://localhost:3000/blog/video_analytics/warehouses#safety)

Safety is another important aspect of warehouse operations. Video analytics can help ensure that the warehouse is a safe place for employees to work. By monitoring the activities of employees, video analytics can identify any unsafe behaviour and alert the local team. This ensures that the team can take quick action and prevent any potential accidents.
